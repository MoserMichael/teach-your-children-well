
## Jewish History

In memory of my dear father, Ilja Moser.

My father used to take me to the [Pergamon museum](https://www.smb.museum/en/museums-institutions/pergamonmuseum/home/) in Berlin, as a kid in the early eighties. We used to visit the [Ishtar gate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2iZ83oIZH0) and processional way of Babylon. My father said: you see, the Jews suffered defeated on the hands of the neo-Babylonian empire, ruled by king Nebuchadnezzar. It was a complete and utter defeat. Jews were brought by force into Babylon and had to walk down this street right after being defeated. Now all these kingdoms are long gone now, however the Jewish people prevailed, just by staying alive. And all of this happened at a time, when the great and mighty cities of Europe were still part of he wilderness.

This was a good lesson. Thank you father.
