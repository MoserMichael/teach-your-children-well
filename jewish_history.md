
## Jewish History

In memory of my dear father, Ilja Moser.

My father used to take me to the [Pergamon museum](https://www.smb.museum/en/museums-institutions/pergamonmuseum/home/) in Berlin, as a kid in the early eighties. We used to visit the [Ishtar gate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2iZ83oIZH0) and processional way of Babylon. My father said: Almost 2600 years ago the Jews were defeated by the neo-Babylonian empire, ruled by king Nebuchadnezzar. It was a complete and utter defeat. Jews were brought by force into Babylon and had to walk down this street right after being defeated. Now all these kingdoms are long gone now, however the Jewish people prevailed, just by staying alive and keeping their tradition. And all of this happened at a time, when the great and powerful cities of Europe were still part of the wilderness.

Your lessons were the best. Thank you dad.
