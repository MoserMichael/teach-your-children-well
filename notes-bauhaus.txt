- weimar school founded in 19191

    - the murals on each floor of the weimar building, each one shows the fundamental shapes: circle, triangle, square (on the third floor is the secreatariat/directors office of Walter Gropius)
        - from a family of architects
        - was a thinker: lets go and redesign society! (took a personality to dream this big!)
        - was drafted in 1914, injured numerous times, traumatized. His mission: how can we use technology in a productive, not destructive way.
        - after the war there was a  expectation of change, new art, new education.
            - Weimar republic: unrest and chaos, conflicts between communist and far right.

        - Gropius accepted the invitation from the before the war to head the applied art school
            - he merged it with the school of fine arts! 
                - that was a hostile takeover, the artists were horrified (lots of politics at the school)
                    - Gropius brought in a lot of stars for his project: 
                - Bauhaus: a radical experiment to bring togather a new school (one person has no impact, says Gropius)
                    - Vasily Kandinsky (one of the most famous painters in Europe,  'painting that is a tool for expression the spririt, not a photographer')
                    - Paul Klee (influental teacher in paintings, transformative lectures on how art and spirituality can go togather ... did 'paintings like childs dream')

                    - Marcel Breuer
                    - Laslo Moholy-Nagy
                    - Oskar Schlemer - always the human figure in his field of interest, both painter and also in theater and dance! (Theater is a big theme for exploring different disciplines! made B. a unique institution) his theme: exploring types of emotion. (you can explore many fields of arts on the stage! 

                - Weimar: the unlikely location for a radical project. The Bauhaus manifesto: "all the arts come togather to create a building of the future(the pinacle of artistic achievement): (Gropius wrote the manifesto to attract talent!)

            - idea of B: there no barrier between a painting an practical things. Chairs must be beatiful: "Gropius considered beaty as a basic requirement of life            - the Bauhaus manifesto was a kind of inspiration to manu students.

            - B. series of experiments in trying to rething the role of desing (after the war)
                - they hired people because they were different! (and because they were experimenting, probably)

            - students came who wanted to break with tradition, attracted by the B. manifesto (the manifesto was a tool for attracting talent)    
                main slogan of the manifesto "Form follows function" (now what does that mean?)

    - The course of study
            - six month introductionary course
            - the workshop


        Introductory course 
           - both men an women were equal during the intro course! (later course this was not the case)
           - was created/formed by Itten. But he he was also bit crazy
           - "equipped students with transferable skills" to work in different media
                (Itten didn't like expressionism - expressionism is trying to "represent the world out of a subjective experience")
           - an exploration of colors, shapes, what Ideas they represent, but also their properties. 
           - Itten said "before you draw a tiger, you have to roar like a tiger"
           - asissted by Gertrude Grunow - she said "there is a harmony between color, sound and movement" so they would teach how to feel these connections. so they said "dance the color blue"
           - breathing exercises, "saw the importance of importance of the subconcious of creative art"

          Itten was kind of a crazy hippy, got involved with a persian cult Mazdaznan (this kind of spiritualism became big after WW1)
          So he was a kind of Guru with followers, that got him in conflict with engineering kind of guys, and he was fired by Gropius.
          But Moholy-Nagy took up the foundation course - and continued in the same tradition!
          Now Gropius pushes through a new motto "unity of art and technology" (that was a big change, says there was a major change in direction every three or four years in the whole B. !)

        Says women were still not equal. At the start there were 50% women "Gropius became concerened about it - he thought that the schoold would not be taken seriously as a result"
            - women had to go into the weaving workshop (no choice) But some persisted to learn in other workshops (had to overcome great obstacles!)

 
    - History of the Bauhaus
          - Weimar period: 
        - bauhaus student challenged then "norms and wanted to influence the world of the better", and shocked everyone in conservative Weimar.
          they poored paint on the Goethe and Schiller statue, and everyone knew it were the students.
          Local government organized a review on what the Bauhaus is doing.
            - pressured the Bauhaus to hold an exhibition of Bauhaus in 1923
            - Gropius didn't like the idea. thought it was too early
            - .. and they took the project seriously, built a whole house for the exhibition! with stuff designed for the house... Everyone is involved with this.
            - the exhibition was a great public relation success in Germany, however the people in Weimar didn't like it.
            - ... Weimar cut fonding by half. And the Weimar government turned nationalist - told them to move.
        - based on the success, they got offers from other parts, from Dessau! 
            - Dessau had the Junkers factory,
            - the local government was communist, they liked the B. an gave them more money.
            - built a whole campus, in their style.
                - it must have been like a spaceship landing in Germany
            - Hannes Meyer was invite to lead the architecture department at B.
            - the Dessay years were the most stable in Weimar, and also for the B.
        
            - had lots of art inspired parties/performances, the biggest party was the birthday of Gropius! May 18th - Gropius day
            - so it was more like the sixties, not like the thirties ;-)
            - lots of opposition from the right,
            - peple really tried to discredit Gropius
            - announced his departure (thought that he was doing harm to the B. because having become a focus of attacks from the right).
            - after that comes the economic crisis of 1929 .... lots of problems (no funding)

        - Hannes Meyer - head of B after Gropius.
            Gropius: he 'encouraged the invention of new forms that would relate with the spiriti of a new society'
            Meyer: 'the lower classes don't care for style, they care for cost and function' (still he was very playful and experimental)

            
            Meyer revived the spriti of B ... to bring prototypes into industry.
                - the bauhaus wall paper was brought to production (brought lots of money)
                    
            With the econ. crisis income from student design becomes very important .... the womens weaving workshop was the largest source of income!

            "Meyer embraced capitalism ... the insitution seemed more financially secure" 
            Meyer got into problems, as he was Marxist (later moved to the Soviet Union - after the Nazis came)

            They had both commies nad nazis as students at the b. it was very polarized... (Gropius tried to keep politics out, now Meyer was very open about his politics)
            The Major of Dessau asked Meyer to leave (against the rising Nazis)

      - 1930 : Meyer had to leave (by request of major of Dessau). Gropius recomended Mies van der Rohe (he brings in a focus on architecture)
            - he was the master architect (unlike Gropius who was more like bringing people togather)a
            - he had a much more authoritarian character: talked with every student to find if they are into politics; threw out twenty students near to Meyer.
            - declared: no politics at Bauhaus

     - 1932: Nazis come to power in Dessau, and cut funding completely, shut the institution down.

            Mies van der Rohe moves the school to Berlin
                - here it has only private funding (not a state institution, like in Dessau)a

      -1933: Reichstag burning - Bauhaus is accused, and Nazis close the thing down, Gestapo interrogates students.
            The teachers decide to close the school, instead of handing it to the nazis.

     
       Most go to a different part of the world, that spreads the whole idea through the world!

            Meyer - goest to the Soviet Union (reconstruction of Moscow, Bierobidzhan, gets out in time before the purges!)
            Gropius - head of architecture at Harward
            Mies van der Rohe - stuck in Chicago (was pissed at Gropius), builds high rises out of steel and glas

                - they say that B came from social democratic Weimar, but came to house the corporate giants of America
                - the social message didn't survive when moving to the USA 'America embraced the look of the Bauhaus, but didn't like the talk of social inclusion'
                    
      Influence: 'The idea that beauty isn't marginal, that beauty is part of human understanding, we need to cling to that thought'
      Ikea: 'is about mass production but also with attention to design ... as marriage of form and function'

Mies Van Der Rohe: "Less is more"

Bauhaus has something to do with minimalist design principles

Bauhaus:

die Kunst von der Industrialisierung zu emanzipieren (selbstaendig machen) und das Kunsthandwerk wiederzubelebe

 Mit dem Begriff „Kunst“ wurde nicht die damalige Avantgarde bezeichnet, sondern die Formensprache der zeitgenössischen Entwerfer für die Produktion im Stil vergangener Epochen.

Handwerk := experimentell und manuell eine neue Formensprache zu entwickeln, die dem industriellen Herstellungsprozess gerecht wird. 

Ein Leitbild des Bauhauses war, die Architektur als Gesamtkunstwerk mit den anderen Künsten zu verbinden

BORN IN THE chaos of the collapse of the German monarchy in 1919, Bauhaus understood itself as a future laboratory where creative brains pondered how humans would live and work in the coming decades.

", Bauhaus was a school that – typical for this modernist and upheaval time period after the first World War – wanted nothing less than to change the world.”"

Bauhaus design philosophy says: "Form follows function"

The aim of founding director Walter Gropius was to create an interdisciplinary academy that combined high arts with architecture and design in experimental teaching methods and practice-oriented workshops.

Hannes Meyer in 1927 that designers strive to “the optimum of function” with products that meet “people’s needs not luxuries”.

“What made it special was the radical way in which so many different artists were brought together, from painters to dramatists to architects, though all styles. And all in one place.”
