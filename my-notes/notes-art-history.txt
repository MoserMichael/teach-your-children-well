Prehistoric arts

    - what is art? how did it come about? prehistoric art tries to deal with these questions: 
        - art is a kind of lie: (Pablo Picasso:  “Art is the lie that enables us to realize the truth.” https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/3253.Pablo_Picasso )
    - what is art? 
        - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Treachery_of_Images  Rene Margarite: "Cecis n'est pas une pipe"
            this is not a pipe - this is a painting of a pipe! It's a painting that pretends to be something else!
            art is a representation, it's not the truth!
        - a smiley: it's not a real face, it's a symbol, an abstraction.
        - we accept the 'equivalence between the image and the object is accepted' ; says 'the ability to project from reality onto an image is very useful to the human species'
    
    - where does it start?
        - Makapansgat valley in Africa: here lived Australopithecus https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australopithecus
          In a cave they found a pebble out of Jasperite that looks like a human face.
            - and it has some scratches that they added, to make it look more like a face!!!
          It was brought from far away! a Manuport is something that was carried from far away!
          
          Says they projected a meaning onto the pebble! 

          https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makapansgat_pebble
        
        - Similar objects: Venus of Berekhat Ram :: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus_of_Berekhat_Ram (by Homo Erectus)
          at the Israel museum. A pebble that looks like a woman, and they made it more look like one! Same as the Mapansgat pebble!

    - movie "cast away" with tom hanks: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cast_Away
        (Tom Hanks - on an island, after a ship wreck: draws a face on a volleyball and calls it Wilson, and talks with it, becomes attached to it, as if it were real)
        What is it that defines art? Says it is the meaning that we put into it - the emotional attachment that we have!
        
        It turns out that elephants and chimpanzees do paint, but do they get attached to the result?
            - bauer bird build complicated nest, to attract mates (and signal its fitness to the mate)
            - Puffer fish builds patterns, also to attract mates.
            - we think that only Humans can create this long term attachment to their drawings!
                 
        Pareidoia :- psychologists say that we have a tendency to see patterns of faces in random objects (like the face on mars)
            - so is the pebble from the Mapansgat valley a work of art, or the result of such a mix-up?
              well, we got minimalistic art in 20th century art - 'bulls head' by Picasso, who took a bycicle seat to create a statue of a 'bulls head'
                - that was he 'recontextualized' some familiar objects
        
        Art and cognitive development: you need to project meaning onto images/objects if you want to craft art.
            - art is a tool that helps you with the mental or spiritual, you can't utilize a work of art.

    - talking about evolution of Humans
        - started in east africa (kenya, Tanzania, Ethiopia)
            Australopithecines (2.5-1 mil. years), walked upright, lived in east africa, had stone tools - didn't know how to make fire, but had manuports (like the pebble)
                
         - Homo Erectus (1.6mil-200.000 years): better stone tools, knew how to make fire, no permanent settlements, no burial practices, no art?!
            they spread to Europe and Asia,
            Tools: perfectly symmetrical flint axes.    
                - they had successive generation of tools, getting better at it. That means they passed the skill to the next generation - they had culture!
                    
            Denis Dutton: says these elaborate hand axes were works of art. (he says that they are supposed to show off fitness of reproduction - like the Bauer bird)
                (for example there is no practical reason to make them symmetrical, you don't need that for the function!
                 some were buried, so they were not intended to be used. so they were symbolic objects (some of them were very big, more than a foot tall, so they must have been of symbolic nature)

      - Homo Sapiens Neandtherthalensis (from 100000 years ago)  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neanderthal
            Advanced tool making, permanent settlements, big innovation - they buried their dead! had complex societies
            (lived in Europe and Asia)

                - we find graves of people with missing hands and feet, so their family had to care for them!
                  you were of value to the group even without a hand,
                  They were painting the bodies of the dead - they found traces of paint. (another form of art)
                  They buried the dead with flowers

                - Burial has implications: they must have seen that the body as an image of the dead person; the body is there but the person, soul is gone.. :-(
                  They must have had some ideas of these concepts, so high cognitive development!!!

           Then come the ice ages (from 60.000 years ago to 10.000)
                - this comes with a technological revolution! (40.000) 
                    - specialization of stone tools: needles, microblades, harpoons, bifacial spear points
       
       - Homo Sapiens Sapiens/Cro-Magnum (from 100.000 years ago)
                - big news: first monumental art, they spread to the whole world (unlike Neandtherthals...)a

                - different art styles in wall paintings and carvings (most of them in caves in Spain and southern France)
                    -Gravettian (35.000-25.000)

                        - Chauvet cave (28000-30000) - first to show predator animals

                    -Solutrean  (25.000-19.000)
                        - Cosquer cave (16000-25000) - on the coast, discovered by divers! under the water!

                        
                    -Magdalenian (20.000-10.000)

                        - Lascaux cave (13000-15000) - many dozens of animals on the ceiling of a cave!

                        - Altamira cave, Spain (12000) - bisons painted on the ceiling of the cave,
                          Incredibly naturalistic paintings, lots of detail! perspective and 3 dimensions!
                          were painted by blowing the paint on the wall! paint is out of mineral pigments.
                          used animal fat to make the paint bind! otherwise it would get off in a couple of years.
                          says blowing the paint of the wall is like breathing the painting into life!!!
                          Also they left a kind of signature - put their hand on the cave and blow the color on top of it - to leave a shaddow of a hand.

                          The animals are often paint into the cracks that appear in the stone - natural cracks.

                - interesting that they start to make art at around 40.000BC, so they speak of "behaviorally modern" vs "anatomically modern" humans.
                     - what makes this difference? Did it come with the ice age tech. revolution? Is it a cultural acquisition, is art invented?
                       No idea!

                     Problem: we see complex societies hunting together etc, at around 80.000 years, so they must have had some language, be able to plan your actions. 
                     Language is a big deal - capacity of abstraction, visualization, conceptualization, but where is art?

                - maybe this is the wrong argument: we might have had different forms of art, like bodily art - tattoos, body paint, hair ornaments, Jewels, performing arts - but these would not last. 
                - maybe they did arts, but not on durable media. (we have some clay figures from 15.000BC, and it survived, big wonder!
                    - sometimes there are religious prohibitions against permanent art

                - what about Neandthertal? We don't see any art from them - maybe it just didn't survive? hard to know...
                    - ladder like figures in La Pasiega cave - dated to much older than 64000 - could have been made by Neandthertal!


        - Why did they do the cave paintings?
            - no piles of trash, so they didn't seem to have lived there.
            - where did they take the light? says they had lanterns out of stone!
              these must have been sacred places!!!
            - paintings are often placed deep down the cave, not near the entrance!
                - probably due to some ritual meaning of the caves.
            - says they were active for thousands of years

            - painting the animals that they hunt?
                - some paintings are much larger than the animal some are smaller
                - they often paint animal over the top of another animal (cave of Trois Freres 17000BC) also in Lascaux cave (13000-15000bc) Chavueat cave - multiple horse paintings, one over the other, redrawn multiple times... a rhinoceros repainted seven times!
                    - says they had ritual meaning, once the ritual ends you can paint another animal over the top of it.
                    - is it some kind of renewal of the animal spirit?
                    - some pictures have strike marks, so maybe that was some kind of symbolic killing / renewing of the animal?
                      must have had some shaman, he paints it, then comes someone who 'kills' the painting - like a voodoo doll.
                      it may be a symbolic action that is supposed to give the hunter good fortune, or something like that!
                    - or maybe not: the indians(and in Mongolia) have rituals: after you kill an animal you need to give an offering to appease the spirit of the animal! or to kill the spirit of an already hunted animal (whatever)

                    - like the Altamira they painted them to fit into the cracks of the cave
                      as if they went into the cave to find the animal, the artist is liberating what he is already seeing, as if in some vision state.
        
                      Also paleolithic scultptures: you would carve an animal to fit the shape of the stone!  sort as if to honor the spirit of the object.
                      
                      Says its like paredoilia - seeing an image in a naturally existing object (sort of like the pebble of Makapansgat)

             - narrative? in cave of Trois Freres they have a guy in a bison skin (as if they pay someone who is hunting - telling a story)

               also a man as if lying in front of a bison (also some kind of story)

             - sculptures: Venus figurines - seem to symbolize fertility (often fit into a hand, probably personal, totem items)
                 - women with big buttocks, big breasts - small faces. emphasizing the parts needed to bear children!
                   Venus of Willendorf (but she has a big head, by comparison, but no face)
                   Venus of Brassempuoy has a face, but not very emphasized
                   They all seem exaggerated, abstract!
            

        - naturalism vs abstraction
            - naturalism - imitation of nature
            - abstraction - don't look like nature, has exaggeration (representing some concept?)
                    
            - Lascaux cave : the animal is drawn in great detail, while a person is just ab abstraction
              maybe there is some prohibition against drawing persons - you don't want to steel their soul. (maybe that was the purpose of the animal drawing...)

            - sometimes abstraction is the better communication tool (like with smileys) - to communicate some mental state, like happiness.
              sometimes the better tools is naturalism - it is a good tool to convey presence! (like with the bisons in the Lscaux cave)

            - the Venus figures are supposed to convey an idea - or function as a totem/talisman.
                - childbirth was a dangerous thing, so they needed an idealized figure to protect the owner - to represent the ideal of fertility.
                "art is a tool, a method of externalizing the internal (making the internal external), giving us a sense of control over the uncontrollable" (?)
                  (in other words, its soemething to deal with your fears, etc)

        
        - Conventions : arts tends to cheat
            - look at Mickey Mouse - you always see the ears, even when you see the mouse in profile!
            - same for cave paintings: they paint two horns even if you see the animal in profile. (but they cheat a little bit - the horns are slightly more bent than the face!) (Chauvet cave, Lascaux cave)  
             - these are conventions: tools to convey meaning, to show what the artist believes to be true - tool to add symbolism. (like stick figures in XKCD) 

             - Lion-man figure: 28000-30000 from Holhlenstein-Stadel - first time you see something that is not real, imaginary thing, combined thing!
                lots of theories what it means...  but he says it shows that people think more in concepts, if they can accept something imaginary...

             - Architecture: Mammoth Hut - 15000, Mezhirich Russia
               lots of Mammoth bones that were used to weigh down the Mammoth skins, but they bones were decorated, incised and painted!


https://www.historytoday.com/archive/natural-histories/prehistoric-horses

    Why so many horses in Lascaux cave?
        - horses are the most common animals depicted!
        - they didn't eat horses (they were to difficult to hunt - too fast)
        - artist was very familiar with horses!
    Versions    
        sympathetic magic - draw something, and it will happen for real.
            Similar to Australian hunter-gatherer praxis.
            Problem: ignores that they didn't eat them a lot


        maybe: "the reflection of a spiritual world view based on the contrast between male and female. Thus, dots, dashes, bison and auroch were ‘masculine’ and ovals, squares, triangles and horses were ‘feminine’. That horses were shown in their ‘mating’ coats was hence testimony to a powerful association between women and fecundity;"

        maybe : " This suggested that the paintings were a record of the visual phenomena experienced during ceremonial ‘voyages’ to a spirit world – and that the animals represented the shadowy entities with which they sought to commune in the hope of healing sickness, changing the weather, or securing food. In this reading, horses would appear as a particularly important spirit, albeit one whose significance remains obscure. "

        maybe they didn't like to paint animals to easy for hunting (reindeer) or too threatening (bison)?
        Horses would have been in the middle ground

        Fascination: maybe the artists were fascinated with horses?
        "aving seen herds galloping across the plains, how could these people not have longed to catch them? How could they not have marvelled at their swiftness and strength? Perhaps, by painting them, they were teaching, hoping, yearning. Perhaps they, like Peter Shaffer’s Equus, were simply crying out in love and defiance: ‘I am yours and you are mine.’ "



   
Timeline:
    
    Paleolithic - (old stone age) 2.5m years ago - 

        Upper paleolithic - 50.000 years ago (lots of new tech!)

    Mesolithic (middle stone age) 20.000 years ago
        - dogs where domesticated at this time!

    Neolithic (new stone age) 12.000  years ago ... 2000 years ago
        - big leap: animal domestication, agriculture, hunting with bow & arrow, fiber arts, etc
    
    Bronze age (5000 years ago - but not in all areas of the world)

    (this is all relative to social/technological development - Britain in 5000BC was in the Neolithic, but Egypt was in the Bronze age!)

Sahara dessert
    10000BC - ice age comes to an end

    10000BC years ago it was a savannah, lots of grass, animals - people
        You have paintings of giraffes carved into rocks, from that time!
        
        end of ice age: people start to cultivate animal herds - pastoralism (big change from hunting/gathering)
            - nomadic people, have to move their herds around.
            - they now have a food surplus (don't have to deal with hunting all day!), more time to develop a culture, don't need to run an hunt/gather all of the time!
                - people can now specialize in their tasks, develop new professions like basket weaving
                - and now trade starts between these specializations!
                - more art as well!
                    - beautiful panels (Tassili N'ajier - Nigeria) - not in caves, in overhangs.
                        - they get the proportions right, between animal and people!
                        - people spreading nets, herding animals, boat, variety of clothing - that's a new variety of stuff!
            
        Near east - lots of action here! The agricultural revolution - takes long time (12000BC-5000BC)
            - agriculture means more food security, more surplus, etc.
                - permanent settlements 
                - need animals bulls to pull your tools

            - Mesopotamia  (between the two rivers Tigris and Euphrates - water for irrigation)
                - dig canals for irrigation,
                - lots of permanent settlements here
            - Levant 
                - don't need canals, there is more rain here.

            - Periods
                - pre 6000BC - pre pottery
                - Pottery neolithic - after 6000BC
                    - needs lots of skill, like removing all the air bubbles out of the clay - otherwise the pots explode in the kiln...
                    - dating by find different styles of pottery on the same layer of excavation!
                
                - also cloth weaving and baskets weaving.

                - took quite a while to figure out the technology, this is complex stuff and needs specialization!

                - metal working, with copper (Chalcolithic)


        Used to think that you absolutely require agriculture for the food surplus for big monumental colture
        Wrong! Gobekli Tepe in Anatolia, Turkey happened without agriculture ("it's like finding a steam engine in the middle ages, shouldn't be there" - (well, Heron of alexandria's steam engine happened in Roman times!!!)

            - large T shape monupents (up to 15 tons) standing in circle! - happened before agriculture 10000-11500 years ago (carbon dated)!
                - carvings of animals - all wild, no domesticated animals! 
                  dug up the trash pits - (lots of info there, what did they eat?) - no sheeps and goats, they ate wild gazelles, before animal domestication!!!
                  shocking conclusion - as there is no surplus at that time.
                - you need skilled artists and lots of stuff for the building: lots of tools and Human specialists, diversification of labor, societies of hundreds and thousands!
                - you can't do it with a small tribe, and they had all of this without agriculture!
        
        Guess: quasi domestication: instead of domestication the animal you shape the environment: kill of all predators burn the prarie so that there will be more grass, then you get more gazelles!

                - maybe agriculture is not a prerequisite to social stratification?
                  maybe social stratification came first? then came agriculture - when people pushed their environment to the limit!!!
                  If its true then culture comes first technological progress comes later!!!

                - problem of trust: smaller societies have trust, you know everyone around and trust them.
                  you don't have this with larger society, you need some cultural glue to hold everyone together, you need religion.
                  Goblekki Teppe is a religious site!

                - first you need to organize your society, bring people together by building a temple, then you can do agriculture!!!


       Timeline: 
            - it's 8000 years between Goebekli Teppe and Sumer (3400BC) - the start of history, when they wrote stuff down
                There must be lots of stuff out there that we don't know about!!!  
            - its 5400 years from then until now.

       Catal Huyuk settlement (occupied for 400 years)
            - mud brick houses with common walls (says to make it it easier to defend)
            - open areas, family units, shrines?
            - ceramic sculptures
            - female figure (again with emphasized breasts and abdomen) with leopards around here - mother/fertility goddess?
            - landscape fresco: town with nearby volcanic eruption!  (says that actually happened at the time!)
        
        Jericho near the dead sea! 
            - neolithic village - dated to 9000BC - pre pottery!
            - defensive structures - speaks of organized society - watchtowers were discovered
            - plastered skull: human skulls - an attempt to preserve the body for the afterlife (lots of cultures here deal with that!)
                - disinterred bodies, took the skull and sealed it in bitumen (like asphalt) put shells into the eyes
                    - like the Mask of Tutankhamun

        Ain-Ghazal in Jordain: they have pre-pottery figurines.
            - these represent figures and were intentionally burried
            - a way of pass them to the afterlife? Votive objects (offerings?), simulacra (an object that stands in for or simulates a human sacrifice)
            
        Neolithic Europe - Europe is still in the stone age, while ME is in bronze age.
            Megalithic - big stone monoliths built by cultures in Britain, North Germany, France, Spain, a bit in Scandinavia.

                    

Ancient near east: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_LcEo-_pLY 

    Fertile crescent - Israel, Syria, southern Turkey, Mesopotamia    
        has water sources (that's why it is called Fertile crescent)
            Levant - reasonable rainfall
            
        
    4000BC - bronze age (need 5-10% tin + bronze, can smelter the stuff at reasonably low temperatures)
        Sumer - 3500BC-2200BC  - writing, astronomical records, law (Greeks get lots of ideas from here!)
            Lots of independent city states 
        Akkadians 
        Neo-Sumerians
        Big break (no much written records)
        Old Babylonians (Amorites)
        Hittites

    each city is it's own state
        - founded on hierarchy (divine kingship)
        - religious centers (temples)
            - organized offices
            - organized rituals
            - community thing (main aspect as cultural binder)
            - builds on ideas of personal salvation
        - trade, writing

    what is civilization?
        - urban living, hierarchy, laws
        - division of labor & trade 
        - temples, centralized worship, organized system of worship

    (there is a system theory based definition of civilization)
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilization#Complex_systems
            Civilization as complex system - as 'group of objects that work in concert to produce some result'
            'Civilizations as networks of cities that emerge from pre-urban cultures and are defined by the economic, political, military, diplomatic, social and cultural interactions among them'

    Kingship := ordained by gods, king is the priest of the gods (no separation of church & state) (? Mesopotamia had separate temple institutions ?)
        - sometimes the kid is a 'god' (Akkadians liked that)
        - sometimes he is not a 'god', but gets his legitimacy from the gods (Sumerians liked that)
            - Gilgamesh: descendent from the gods
    
    11:05 Inana (Sumerian) Ishtar (Akkadian) token gift (mass produced) (from Akkadian times) - associated with planet Venus (and war)
        Says you can see it's a goddess
            - standing on the back of lions
            - flanked by owls 
            - has wings
            - has knots (symbol of authority)
            - bull horn crown)
        BIG ROLE OF BINDING COMMUNITY TOGETHER

    Writing:  (says comes from trade)
    First writing was a kind of record keeping (symbol of what is counted + number of items)
        - 16:11 tells about proto-writing system (tokens + seals on tokens)
        - 16:27 nice slide: shows how cuneiform evolved.
    First tables were just for record keeping, then they figured out to write other stuff down!
        Kish tablet 18:32 - first tablet is about ... how many taxes were paid...

    Later they figured to keep stories! 
        Clay tables would be recycled, but sometimes the library burns down and turns to stone...
        Gilgamesh Epos
            - retells the story
    
    Writing makes a big difference - we can tell what Art is about (which deities, which kings... That makes a big difference! now we got history!)
        but... "historians lie" - you need to cross correlate different sources!
        25:04 - map of Sumerian city states
            cities & walls build out of mud brick (not much stones)
            Uruk - first city

    Specialization of whole cities 
        Economy: laws of comparative advantage:: is someone is good at making cloths, then no use to employ him in any other area. https://www.masterclass.com/articles/learn-economics-the-law-of-comparative-advantage


    Anu - chief Sumerian creator deity, that creates out of chaos (waters) ! Creates the first mountain.
    Anu creates other deities: Enliln Inana, etc. 
    Anu lives on a mountain - but now mountains in lower Mesopotamia. So they build their temples high - as mountains
        temples have an inner sanctuary (residence of the deity)
    (most of them don't last that long - out of mud brick)

        - few sculptures (lime stone has to be imported)

    - Uruk Vase https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warka_Vase (3200BC)
        - vase was used to store offerings
        - shows a narrative relief (
        - shows procession of offering
        - hierarchy of scale : more important people are larger, more important people are higher up
        
        34:11 - a person being dressed (for the afterlife), and they give him food for the journey.
        who is the big one? Probably a king
        (wikipedia says "This scene may illustrate a reproduction of the ritual marriage between the goddess and Dumuzi(Tammuz) - consort of shepherds!, her consort that ensures Uruk's continued vitality")

      - temple of Anu, Eshunnah 34:53 35:20  (2600-2300BC)
            - lots of limestone figures with big eyes (probably praying)
            - figures are buried in the foundation of the temple.
            - (also see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tell_Asmar_Hoard )
            - found a big 'death pit' big grave of high status individuals  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Cemetery_at_Ur - Woollley assumed that they were all killed with the king/queen... (assumes only the king gets to the afterlife, in early bronze age)
              found incredible amount of gold jewelry.
              40:47 decorations of the lyre (animals with human hands, playing musical instruments)
              42:08 The standard of Ur (a box with inlays)

                Side A: peace scene: (king receives tribute in good times)
                    - lower line: people bring tribute
                    - second line: priests bring animals to sacrifice
                    - upper line: the king (the big one), nobles, small musicians
                      conventions: face in profile, but eye is looking at us.
                Side B: war scene 45:10, war is the domain of the king (it's his job to finance the thing)
                    - lower line: war carts drawn by donkey (they didn't have domesticated horses yet!) - they trample the enemy
                    - middle line: prisoners taken captive
                    - upper line: king receives prisoners/tribute - a triumph scene

The Akkadians are coming! (Sargon the great comes from the north in 2334BC and conquers Sumeria)
    - Akkadians are god kings (Sumerians don't say that, they get divine legitimacy, right to rule)
    - first true nation state, all nations were ruled by one king.
    - very militaristic
    - lots of art! 
        48:05 metal cast of bronze - face of Sargon
            - lost wax method for casting metal (that's very difficult to do!)
                - add something to a clay model (additive method)
                - make a mold around the clay model
                - fill that with wax.
                - enclose the wax model with clay or plaster (this is called the investment) - melt the wax away.
                - now fill the empty space with metal! (need to have holes, so that fumes can get out, without that the thing will explode)
        Says Akkadian rulers were hated, they damaged and buried this metal likeness when they were overthrown, even didn't reuse the metal!
        damaged the eyes of the statue - to disempower it.
    
       Stele of Naram-Sin (grandson of Sargon) - the stele is a kind of sign-post at the border.
            - much more naturalistic, but the depiction is a scary victory of Naram-Sin
            - Naram-Sin shown as a god (large, with horns, under the sun) trampling on dead bodies, enemies with spears in their throat.
            - says that's not nice 
            (? what about the stele of vultures? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stele_of_the_Vultures wiki says that this was a prototype!)

Neo-Sumerian empire - get rid of the Akkadians, now they learn from them - and have a king that unites the city states (in Ur III - 3d dynasty)
    - massive ziggurat at Ur built by Ur-Nammu,
        - Ur-Nammu makes a law code (like Hammurabi)  (bronze statue shows increased naturalism)
        - Stele of Ur-Nammu - the king offers a libation to the gods (and looks the god in the eye) - as a servant of the gods. (but they would declare kings as gods after their death - see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gudea )
        - Ziggurat is integrated into palace complex - no separate entity of temple!
            - ziggurat elevates the deity above the plain (quite massive! we only see the remains - mud bricks)
    - Gudea of Lagash (2100BC) - he is a governor of Lagash, He also expands the bureaucracy! https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gudea
        - had lots of statues out of diorite - imported stone.
        - naturalistic depiction of devotion
        - has cuneiform inscription in the stone (hard to do!) and picture of temple on his lap, as he restored the temple (1:05:06)

2004BC fall of the Neo Sumerian empire (Ur-III)

Old Babylonian empire, 
    1792 Hammurabbi - they assimilate the culture of Sumerians (but they speak a semitic language, like the Akkadians)
        - makes a law code - carved on stele made of imported diorite,  (some deity looks Hammurabi into the eyes (divine legitimacy) gives rod to the king!)
            - says units of measurement were made from body of king, but here the standard of measurement is that of the god!)
        - rule of law (frees you from cycle of revenge and retribution)
        - Hammurabi says that his deity called him to bring "righteousness in the land" ! (law needs divine authority)
        - tiered system of justice, but they had due process!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKf3g3APonw  Venus of Berkhat Ram

    Prof. Naama Goren-Inbar found it 
        - Homo Erectus did that - they shaped a rock, but most of it comes from nature.
        - sophisticated technological abilities : modifying flint
        - dating: horizon of excavation is sandwitched between two bazalt flows, which can be dated accurately
        - lots of argument: is it a figure?

(Funny, they didn't mention that some kind of pigment/color was later found on that figurine...)

Nile river gives the water required for hydraulic civilization, 
    - annual floods - before Aswan dam
    - floods brought lots of nutrients from sediments (no need for fertilizers)
    - Can have two crops/harvests per year!
Connected via narrow strip to Sinai - allows a good defence.

Upper Egypt - the high lands to the south
    Thebes, valey of kings, temples of Karnak/Luxor - capital of upper E., near the great bend of the Nile 
    Cataracts - can't navigate by water (they had to pull the barges)!
        
Lower Egypt - the lower lands to the north (confusing)
    Nile delta
    Giza plateau (around Cairo, pyramids, Memphis - the ancient capital of lower Egypt)


History (longest running civilization, lasted for longer than China!)
    Early dynastic period
    Old kingdom (build the pyramids)
    First intermediate period (no unified Egypt)
    Middle Egypt (center shifts from lower Egypt to upper Egypt)
    Second intermediate period (invasion of Hyksos)
    New kingdom
    18th-19th dynasties - dominates the Levant region. (1550BC-1189BC)
    then decline sets in...

Origin of Egyptian civilization
    - did it come from the east?
        - writing is different from Cuneiform. Totally different religion.
    - did they come from the Sahara, as the desert dried out?
        - 11:32 similar style of art - with desert paintings!!!
    - is it a mix?

    People who live in modern Egypt have the same genetics as the ancient Egyptians!
    
Early sites
    Hierakonopolis - near Luxor, big bend :: mud brick tombs with paintings!  (one of four power centers in Upper Egypt that preceded the consolidation of Upper Egypt at the end of the Naqada III period)

        paintings have themes - that appear in later periods 12:52
            - bend shepherd staff that is forked at bottom - Was-sceptre (symbol of power) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Was-sceptre
            - Egyptian bark
            - guy bound up enemies and is going to smash their heads with a mace/club (they liked this pose - pose of dominion)

              Narmer palette 
                King wears the crown of upper Egypt (as he conquers lower Egypt)
                (conquered enemies always have squatted noses and short beards)

                On the back side he is wearing the crown of lower Egypt

              Pharaoh is a god king (is link between the people and afterlife and Egypt's gods)  

              Mastaba complex (2800BC) - the houses of the dead (built out of stone, more permanent! not mudbrick (like the rest of them))                     
                - purpose: family temple, they get here to provide for the person in the afterlife (by offerings/libations) /first stone building in the world!/   
                - lots of art is built around funerary cult/afterlife. (22:10 - structure of such a building)
                - Concept Ka and Ba https://www.historymuseum.ca/cmc/exhibitions/civil/egypt/egcr05e.html
                    (says there are more parts - 11!)
                    Ka - life force of a person (remains with the body) (symbolized by arms pointing up)
                        ("the Ka has to be sustained" for Ka having an afterlife - that's why they did mummies! Or by these offerings at the site!
                          they had a statue of the dead - for the purpose of preserving the Ka)
                        Pharaoh gets a big pyramid, because he is the Ka of Egypt (collective effort to build megalithic thingy) 
                        others get a smaller one (two foot mud brick pyramid in this kind of building)

                        Had very early realistic individual depictions for high ranking individual (to preserve the Ka) 41:17 ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Seated_Scribe )
                        But Pharaoh looks different/idealized (heroic/impassive/god like) - he is the embodiment of Egypt https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khafre
                        Menkaura & Queen - the guy is striding forward, shows power/initiative https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menkaure

                    Ba - spirit/personality - leaves the body when you die (human headed bird)
                    Akh - spirit of person that 'becomes one with light after death'
                    
                - says only the king in Sumer has a chance for the afterlife, in Egypt old kingdom everybody had a chance (that's what they say)

     Rigid Canon in Egyptian art (see that in Sumerian art too!)
         They must have had rules - the pictures are consistent over a long long time!
         (even Roman emperor Augustus was depicted as making offering to Isis! 40:29) Temple of Dendur  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_of_Dendur

        - head in profile
        - hands and feet in profile
        - eye looking at you
        - chest forward
        why?
            - profile is very easy to read, show it big. (profile presents the life force/ka) (?)

        Gestures in art: (means of communicating intent)
            - gesture of acceptance (put your hand on the knee)
            - gesture of adoration/Obeyance (pull your hands up)
 
        Hieroglyphs
            common themes: prayers for the afterlife, theme of just living in hope of afterlife,

            Carchouche of pharaoh https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartouche 
                - who was this? They carved these deep into the stone, so that it is harder to erase them.
                  (they believed that erasing them damages their Ka in the afterlife ... politics)
                  (Ren - the name is one aspect of the soul)

       They had sense of proportion (39:23) unfinished tombs show grid lines/plans/marks of correction!

    Lower egypt - Saqqara (city of the dead) 
        - step pyramid of Pharaoh Djoser https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyramid_of_Djoser (first pyramid, designed by Imhotep) (2630-2611BC)
        - step pyramid was build around a mastaba (45:40), then build smaller mastabas on top - then got the pyramid form!
        - other buildings in the comples:
            Heb-sed court "jubilee was a ritual or a set of rituals that allowed the living king, after he had ruled for some years, to magically refresh his physical powers and thus continue to reign." http://www.ancient-egypt.org/history/early-dynastic-period/3rd-dynasty/horus-netjerikhet/funerary-complex/heb-sed-court.html (must run around the place, says the lecturer) Here you have the first columns, ever! Hall filled with columns!
            MSerdab - building for the Ka statue https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serdab
                - there is a wall with two holes, you can see the Ka statue - but that's so that the statue can 'look what' outside'
                  towards the direction of star Thuban (near Polaris) - few thousand years ago that was the north star!
                  Why? Horizon represents passing into afterlife (everything was a cycle of birth life deaf rebirth) Cosmic boat would carry the sun
                       North star is fixed doesn't pass beyond horizon -> therefore stand for/represent immortality
                  (wiki says the story with the holes is more complicated: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serdab )

     Other rules of the old kingdom wanted their pyramids: but they get a flat surface (incremental development, not sure why that happened)
        they get bigger, as the kingdom gets richer. The great pyramids of Giza (fourth dynasty) exhausted the resources of the kingdom!
            - (the big one, Khufu was build 2580-2560BC)
            - says building these is more of a logistical miracle than a technical one. 1:00:08 these big things were moved by sledges - and lots of guys pulling. or via water - by barges. Lots of ramps around the pyramid 'under construction' (they found remnants of ramps)
            - logistics: they are only building during flood season (when people where sitting idle); then need a big crew
              Site surrounded by city of temporary workers - for 100.000 people! 1:03:10
            - weren't built by slaves: the Pharao is sacred - Egyptians must build that! Building that thing was a source of pride (inscriptions!
            )
            - pyramids were covered with limestone (later removed in middle ages for building Mosques)
            - lots of time ago the Nile passed buy the pyramids (shifted course since) - to bring the barge of the ruler to the funerary temple (for mummification)
            - lots of chambers inside the pyramids - again they have a site towards the north star, the other to Orion (associated with Osiris - of the afterlife)
            - 1:07:28 - the chambers within the pyramids must deal with lots of stress - so they put lots of smaller chambers with very large slabs, to remove stress.
       Outside the pyramid they found a massive disassembled boat! 1:08:58 (made out of Cedars from Lebanon)     
            
        
       Second largest pyramid is higher up (Khafre) looks larger - is built higher up. Has the great Sphinx (carved out of a living rock!) 1:18:08 nearby & temple.
            - the head is a solid rock, but furthery own they had softer limestone, so they had to cover that with other stones, to give it shape!

       Pyramid of Menkaure - was covered with polished granite /some of it is left/ (not limestone)
          
Middle kingdom
    capital moved to Thebes, upper Egypt
    smaller tombs
    bigger one: Mortuary temple of Mentuhotep (of queen/Pharaoh https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatshepsu)
        (they say that the big pyramids were too expensive - exhausted old kingdom)

    get a sense of everyday life in middle kingdom; they had little figurines of the servants - as stand-in for the real servants.
        - you get a model of a carpenter shop, brewery, etc. etc. - shows how they made stuff!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_OB1dnmjsA - Egypt - new kingdom


2nd intermediate period - the Hyksos are coming! (1640-1532BC) conquered Egypt for a century!
    - cultural exchange between Levant and Egypt (see that in Tel-Megiddo artifacts 1:25)

    - consolidation of power (Thebes, temple of Karnak of Amun-Ra
        Amun-Ra https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amun "transcendental, self-created[2] creator deity "par excellence"; he was the champion of the poor or troubled and central to personal piety." most important deity of New Kingdom (with exception of Amarna period)
        founder of 18th dynasty (who expelled the Hyksos) came from Thebes, and Amun was the local deity there - all the spoils got to Thebes, to the local temple!
        So Amun became the god of the underdog, upholder of justice for the poor and Maat, protector of travellers

        Horns of Amun - since they conquered Kush, the local deity there had horns, and was 'associated with Amun'

        merger with sun god Ra - 'Amun became identified with the chief deity who was worshipped in other areas during that period, namely the sun god Ra. This identification led to another merger of identities, with Amun becoming Amun-Ra.'

        High priest of Thebes "were effectively the rulers of Egypt from 1080 to c. 943 BC.  "
        in 1080 BC ... he Amun priesthood exercised an effective hold on Egypt's economy. The Amun priests owned two-thirds of all the temple lands in Egypt and 90 percent of her ships and many other resources."
        "the Amun priests were as powerful as the pharaoh, if not more so. One of the sons of the High Priest Pinedjem would eventually assume the throne and rule Egypt for almost half a century as pharaoh Psusennes I, while the Theban High Priest Psusennes III would take the throne as king Psusennes II—the final ruler of the 21st Dynasty."
        "In the 10th century BC, the overwhelming dominance of Amun over all of Egypt gradually began to decline"

        Maʽat "concepts of truth, balance, order, harmony, law, morality, and justice, - natural order of things -"
        "Maat was also the goddess (young woman with ostrich feather on her head) who personified these concepts, and regulated the stars, seasons, and the actions of mortals and the deities who had brought order from chaos at the moment of creation. " the opposite of Isfet "injustice, chaos, violence or to do evi"

        "Pharaohs are often depicted with the emblems of Maat to emphasise their roles in upholding the laws and righteousness"

        "From the Eighteenth Dynasty (1550 - 1295 BC) Maat was described as the daughter of Ra, indicating that pharaohs were believed to rule through her authority."
        "The ancient Egyptians had a deep conviction of an underlying holiness and unity within the universe. Cosmic harmony was achieved by correct public and ritual life. Any disturbance in cosmic harmony could have consequences for the individual as well as the state."

        "In addition, several other principles within ancient Egyptian law were essential, including an adherence to tradition as opposed to change, the importance of rhetorical skill and the significance of achieving impartiality and "righteous action""

        "To the Egyptian mind, Maat bound all things together in an indestructible unity: the universe, the natural world, the state, and the individual were all seen as parts of the wider order generated by Maat. "

        "the patron of scribes who is described as the one "who reveals Maat and reckons Maat; who loves Maat and gives Maat to the doer of Maat"

        "Illiterate people had a priority to get scribes to their villages because this procedure allowed the government to limit excessive abuses by pointing out the importance of the complaints of the poor. Scribal instructional texts emphasize fair treatment of all peoples and how anyone who abuses their power is subject to punishment.[31] Although this procedure was regulated by the local government, it helped provide the poor with the feeling that their petitions were put before higher officials' requests.[32] Although the main responsibility of scribes was to compose the work, transfer it or communicate, some scribes added additional commentary. The scribe's role in judicial system should also be taken into consideration. Local and insignificant crimes were usually led by a scribe or a foreman during the trial.[32] " !!!

New Kingdom - largest extent of Egypt. Empire
    - Ramses II - descendant of Hyksos kings (partially)
        18th - 19th dynasties are the big ones (with Amarna period in them Middle)
            - lots of rulers is talking about
                Hatshepsut (half brother husband - Tutmose II) - a girl, very successful rule, but controversial (the Ka should be embodied by a guy). So she was depicted as a guy/took on some aspects of a male identity in most depictions
                    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatshepsut
                        "She managed to rule as regent for a son who was not her own, defying the system which had previously only allowed direct mothers to rule on behalf of their biological sons. Moreover, she used this regency to manufacture her female kingship, constructing extensive temples to celebrate her reign, thereby forcing the public to grow accustomed to seeing a woman in such a powerful role. This ensured that when the oracle declared her king, the Egyptian public readily accepted her status"

                        "Hatshepsut re-established the trade networks that had been disrupted during the Hyksos "
                   
                        Lots of building projects "temples to build her religious base and legitimacy beyond her position as God's Wife of Amun
                           - she has a very big funerary temple (multiple floors!) with big status of Osiris - but with the face of Hatshepsut - but with a ceremonial beard! ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osiris )

                             Says the job of pharaoh was to personify the gods - and that gods were male 
                             (But Wiki says there were was one other woman pharaoh, and that they had women as regents, and "Women had a relatively high status in Ancient Egypt and enjoyed the legal right to own, inherit, or will property" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatshepsut )

                             And she also shows up as goddess Hathor https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hathor

                            Osiris holds both the shepherds crook (carrot) and staff of was (stick) (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Was-sceptre)  - symbol of "symbols of power or dominion" - "In a funerary context the was sceptre was responsible for the well-being of the deceased, and was thus sometimes included in the tomb-equipment or in the decoration"
                           
                 Akhenaten - decides there is a single G-d - Aten - the sun disk, banishes worship of other gods.
                            - 11:16 relief of offering symbols of upper Egypt (lotus blossoms) and lower Egypt (papyri stems?) And the sun rays bring back symbol of life - in a hand stretching from the rays (Ankh - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ankh )
                            - moves capital to Amarna,  (the powerful priests of Amon-Ra are completely pissed)
                            - big shift in style of art! 
                                - no idealized depiction of rulers - wide, long face (had an elongated scull and chin, lots of explanations/guesses why this happens!)
                                    - could it be a genetic abnormality? no it doesn't seem to have been a genetic disease -based on the mummy (right now they say so)

                                    - were his facial features exaggerated in his depictions? (also the same for the other members of the family, wife Nefertiti

                                - big break in style with the long tradition; it is explained by the change in Religion!
                                    - also tone of depiction changed!
                                        18:26 - Akhenaten cradles his child and gives her a kiss!!! Much more humane!
                                                same scale of Akhenaten and Nefertiti - they look each other eye to eye! much more humane!

                                        19:34 - bust portrait of queen Nefertiti (we don't have bust portraits of queens! they only had full body portraits)
                                                says it was found in a workshop, so it was probably a 'master copy'
                                                made of lime stone - but covered in thin layer of stucco (cement water and sand mixture?)
                                                lots of detail! Uncompromising naturalism! - but exaggerated neck and elongated head.

                                        21:56 - tomb of Nebamun https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomb_of_Nebamun 
                                            - has hierarchy of scale, but to a less extent! That means some of the changes remained after the Amarna period!

                                        23:02 - banqueting scene: wife clings in affection (new) Musicians in three quarter/frontal view - overlapping! all new!
                                                 (they didn't do that in order not to damage the Ka)

                Tutankhamen - reverted the religion. 
                    Amon-Ra was kind of a monism (all other gods were seen as aspects of Amon-Ra, sort of like Hindus do!)
                    ruled short (between age 12-18) but his tomb was not robbed (unlike so many others) because the tomb was under a lot of rubble! So he got famous in modern times!
                        Valley of the kings - tombs of 18-20th dynasty Pharaos (Howard Carter excavated by the 'kings lists' scrolls!) The tomb of Tutankhamen was missing, and Carter thought that it must be there - in its original form (and he was right!)
                            https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Carter

                            - 30:50  more about the tomb, just three rooms (the others were much bigger, but were all looted)
                                - it even has bundles of mummified food, for the afterlife!
                                34:45 - even the goddess of Seiket is depicted more naturalistic - the figure has a tummy! They say that stayed from Akhenaten!
                                37:12 - golden throne, it still has the solar rays, and no figures of other gods (Rays are common theme in religion of Aten! Theory: this was made at the time of Akhenaten!) His wife is displayed as a god.
                                
                                40:11 - three coffins nested (like Matryoshka dolls) - out of gold, with the mummy inside - with the famous golden death mask!
                                        the lower half face of the reconstructed mummy is the same as the gold mask
                                        but the eyes are depicted larger, more expressive - says it tries to convey the sense that he counts as a god (?)

                Ramesses II https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramesses_II (34 year rule, lots of campaigns, all to Syria - against Hittites)
                    - Hyksos descendant (actually the mummy looks very different from his idealized statues!)
                    - big builder, has colossal statues of himself (43:58) also built a lot of big temples at Karnak 44:45
                      Karnak Temple (built by Ramesses II)
                        - big gates called Pylon https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pylon_(architecture) (two pyramidal towers, both with a kind of crown (cornice) between them is the gate (half the height of the towers)
                          "he pylon mirrored the hieroglyph akhet 'horizon', which was a depiction of two hills "between which the sun rose and set" -  played a critical role in the symbolic architecture of a building associated with the place of re-creation and rebirth"
                          "Pylons were often decorated with scenes emphasizing a king's authority since it was the public face of a building"
                          "Contemporary paintings of pylons show them with long poles flying banners."

                        - temple leads from large spaces (for the public) to small spaces (for the priests), all separated by pylons (45:25 - reconstruction)
                        - at the entrance: alley of ram headed sphinxes (associated with Amun-Ra)
                        - alley connecting the building parts - with big columns and very big statues (of Ramses), big obelisk (this one was built by Hatshepsut)
                        - after the big Pylon - second line of columns (even bigger, they must have been painted! 47:40 - reconstruction)
                        - then leads to the more sacred/restricted parts - had a wooden ship with a very old figure of Amen-re (every day the statue is brought out and washed, once a year - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opet_Festival the bark would leave the temple - would be carried at the feast of Opeth, and carried to temple of Luxor (festival is during the flooding of the Nile)
                            "Once at the Luxor Temple, a ritual marriage ceremony between the Pharaoh and Amun-Re took place in the Birth room, spiritually linking them to ensure the Pharaoh’s fertility and reinstate the Pharaoh as the intermediary between the gods and Egypt. During the marriage ceremony, the Pharaoh was ceremoniously reborn through a re-crowning ceremony, emphasising the fertile nature of the Pharaoh and legitimising his divine right to rule"


                      Luxor temple - (even bigger than Karnak temple)  Ramesses II did a lot of extensions here.
                      dedicated to the Ka of Egypt (wiki says to the royal Ka - of the king), they believed that the universe was created here. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luxor_Temple
                      " Luxor temple is dedicated to the rejuvenation of kingship; it may have been where many of the pharaohs of Egypt were crowned in reality or conceptually"
                        
                      Abu Simbel (52:15) - in north Egypt  Carved into the sandstone! (big temple with seated figures at entrance (all with the face of Ramesees II) smaller one with standing figures)
                        - north of the Assuan Dam - they had to move the whole mountain up, when the dam was build, because it would have been flooded!!!
                          big trick: once a year in the light shines down on a day in February - right onto the figure of Ramesses in the inner temple (says that's the day of his coronation)

            Ramesses III temple (55:28) now we get to the see people!
                56:41 - the same pose of Pharao holding a mace to smash the heads of the enemies (the first one was 2500 years back!)
                best preserved temple, even has the color preserved! 57:06


            (summing up) Egyptians thought that they can find peace in the afterlife (also if Pharaoh prospers then everyone prospers)
            

            https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_the_Dead
                "generally written on papyrus and used from the beginning of the New Kingdom (around 1550 BCE) to around 50 BCE."
                original term: "Book of Coming Forth by Day[3] or Book of Emerging Forth into the Light."
                "number of magic spells intended to assist a dead person's journey through the Duat, or underworld, and into the afterlife and written by many priests over a period of about 1,000 years. "
                "Some people seem to have commissioned their own copies of the Book of the Dead, perhaps choosing the spells they thought most vital in their own progression to the afterlife."

            The book of the dead of Hunefer - has lots of pictures
            Anubis is god that guides them through the scary underwold - Duat (realm of the dead) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duat

            "Duat, it is not equivalent to the conceptions of Hell in the Abrahamic religions, in which souls are condemned with fiery torment. The absolute punishment for the wicked, in ancient Egyptian thought, was the denial of an afterlife to the deceased, ceasing to exist in ꜣḫ form. The grotesque spirits of the underworld were not evil, but rather acted as directed by the gods, to provide the various ordeals that the deceased had to face"
            
            - pass through a series of tests/ordeals and gates - until judgement. Anubis is your guide.
            - the judgement is a vesal/weight. The heart (contains record of your deads) is weighted against the feather of Ma'at. (heart must weight less than the feather)
                 - the test are like a series of confessions...
                 - bla bla bla...
                 - at the end of times: the Ba (soal) and the Ka (life force) will unite into Ahk (resurrected being)


            Satirical papyri:
                - they made fun of stuff! (depict animals) social inversions


        Iron age (enters decline from 20th dynasty) 
            25th dynasty - the Nubians conquers, and rules from Nubia!
             a lot of culture gets exported to Nubia, they also copy the art (sculptures inspired by Egyptian art)

        Persians / Ptolemaeic Greek / Romans - all conquer Egypt in turns.

            Cleopatra, sometimes she looks Greek, sometimes depicted in Egyptian style (they had Greek law for the Greeks, and Egyptian law for the rest)
                even funerary practice merge, kind of ... Later you get Anubis in Roman armor.
                temple of Augustus at Dendur  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_of_Dendur - Egyptian style everywhere!

       4th Century - Theodosius bans all pagan practices, and vandalizes lots of monuments...

       After Egyptian conquest you see lots of Egyptian motives in European art (Egyptian revivals...)

Near East - iron age.

    All the bronze age civilization were connected by trade! Lots of stuff being traded!!!

    Uluburun shipwreck (14th CBC) shows extent of trade https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uluburun_shipwreck
        - had oil, wine, ingots of glass, oil amphors, ceramics, textiles, bronze copper tin ingots (most important!), weapons! (spears, axes, Khopesh = sickle shaped sword)
            - bronze doesn't rust, very versatile, hard, relatively low melting temperature - problem: tin is rare (need 4-10%) need long distance trade!
                tin: Spain, England, Afghanistan - needs long distance trade, no way around!

https://www.britannica.com/topic/hydraulic-civilization

"Wittfogel believed that wherever irrigation required substantial and centralized control, government representatives monopolized political power and dominated the economy, resulting in an absolutist managerial state. 
In addition, there was a close identification of these officials with the dominant religion and an atrophy of other centres of power. The forced labour for irrigation projects was directed by the bureaucratic network. Among these hydraulic civilizations, Wittfogel listed ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, China, and India and pre-Columbian Mexico and Peru.
"

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oriental_Despotism

    Aristotle, the proto-racist! "Aristotle asserted that oriental despotism was not based on force, but on consent. Hence, fear could not be said to be its motivating force, but rather the servile nature of those enslaved, which would feed upon the power of the despot master. Within ancient Greek society, every Greek man was free and capable of holding office; both able to rule and be ruled. In contrast, among the barbarians, all were slaves by nature. Another difference Aristotle espoused was based on climates. He observed that the peoples of cold countries, especially those of Europe, were full of spirit but deficient in skill and intelligence, and that the peoples of Asia, although endowed with skill and intelligence, were deficient in spirit and hence were subjected to slavery. Possessing both spirit and intelligence, the Greeks were free to govern all other peoples."

"This despotism differed from the Western experience, where power was distributed among contending group"
