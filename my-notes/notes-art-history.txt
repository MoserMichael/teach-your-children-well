Prehistoric arts

    - what is art? how did it come about? prehistoric art tries to deal with these questions: 
        - art is a kind of lie: (Pablo Picasso:  “Art is the lie that enables us to realize the truth.” https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/3253.Pablo_Picasso )
    - what is art? 
        - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Treachery_of_Images  Rene Margarite: "Cecis n'est pas une pipe"
            this is not a pipe - this is a painting of a pipe! It's a painting that pretends to be something else!
            art is a representation, it's not the truth!
        - a smiley: it's not a real face, it's a symbol, an abstraction.
        - we accept the 'equivalence between the image and the object is accepted' ; says 'the ability to project from reality onto an image is very useful to the human species'
    
    - where does it start?
        - Makapansgat valley in Africa: here lived Australopithecus https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australopithecus
          In a cave they found a pebble out of Jasperite that looks like a human face.
            - and it has some scratches that they added, to make it look more like a face!!!
          It was brought from far away! a Manuport is something that was carried from far away!
          
          Says they projected a meaning onto the pebble! 

          https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makapansgat_pebble
        
        - Similar objects: Venus of Berekhat Ram :: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus_of_Berekhat_Ram (by Homo Erectus)
          at the Israel museum. A pebble that looks like a woman, and they made it more look like one! Same as the Mapansgat pebble!

    - movie "cast away" with tom hanks: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cast_Away
        (Tom Hanks - on an island, after a ship wreck: draws a face on a volleyball and calls it Wilson, and talks with it, becomes attached to it, as if it were real)
        What is it that defines art? Says it is the meaning that we put into it - the emotional attachment that we have!
        
        It turns out that elephants and chimpanzees do paint, but do they get attached to the result?
            - bauer bird build complicated nest, to attract mates (and signal its fitness to the mate)
            - Puffer fish builds patterns, also to attract mates.
            - we think that only Humans can create this long term attachment to their drawings!
                 
        Pareidoia :- psychologists say that we have a tendency to see patterns of faces in random objects (like the face on mars)
            - so is the pebble from the Mapansgat valley a work of art, or the result of such a mix-up?
              well, we got minimalistic art in 20th century art - 'bulls head' by Picasso, who took a bycicle seat to create a statue of a 'bulls head'
                - that was he 'recontextualized' some familiar objects
        
        Art and cognitive development: you need to project meaning onto images/objects if you want to craft art.
            - art is a tool that helps you with the mental or spiritual, you can't utilize a work of art.

    - talking about evolution of Humans
        - started in east africa (kenya, Tanzania, Ethiopia)
            Australopithecines (2.5-1 mil. years), walked upright, lived in east africa, had stone tools - didn't know how to make fire, but had manuports (like the pebble)
                
         - Homo Erectus (1.6mil-200.000 years): better stone tools, knew how to make fire, no permanent settlements, no burial practices, no art?!
            they spread to Europe and Asia,
            Tools: perfectly symmetrical flint axes.    
                - they had successive generation of tools, getting better at it. That means they passed the skill to the next generation - they had culture!
                    
            Denis Dutton: says these elaborate hand axes were works of art. (he says that they are supposed to show off fitness of reproduction - like the Bauer bird)
                (for example there is no practical reason to make them symmetrical, you don't need that for the function!
                 some were buried, so they were not intended to be used. so they were symbolic objects (some of them were very big, more than a foot tall, so they must have been of symbolic nature)

      - Homo Sapiens Neandtherthalensis (from 100000 years ago)  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neanderthal
            Advanced tool making, permanent settlements, big innovation - they buried their dead! had complex societies
            (lived in Europe and Asia)

                - we find graves of people with missing hands and feet, so their family had to care for them!
                  you were of value to the group even without a hand,
                  They were painting the bodies of the dead - they found traces of paint. (another form of art)
                  They buried the dead with flowers

                - Burial has implications: they must have seen that the body as an image of the dead person; the body is there but the person, soul is gone.. :-(
                  They must have had some ideas of these concepts, so high cognitive development!!!

           Then come the ice ages (from 60.000 years ago to 10.000)
                - this comes with a technological revolution! (40.000) 
                    - specialization of stone tools: needles, microblades, harpoons, bifacial spear points
       
       - Homo Sapiens Sapiens/Cro-Magnum (from 100.000 years ago)
                - big news: first monumental art, they spread to the whole world (unlike Neandtherthals...)a

                - different art styles in wall paintings and carvings (most of them in caves in Spain and southern France)
                    -Gravettian (35.000-25.000)

                        - Chauvet cave (28000-30000) - first to show predator animals

                    -Solutrean  (25.000-19.000)
                        - Cosquer cave (16000-25000) - on the coast, discovered by divers! under the water!

                        
                    -Magdalenian (20.000-10.000)

                        - Lascaux cave (13000-15000) - many dozens of animals on the ceiling of a cave!

                        - Altamira cave, Spain (12000) - bisons painted on the ceiling of the cave,
                          Incredibly naturalistic paintings, lots of detail! perspective and 3 dimensions!
                          were painted by blowing the paint on the wall! paint is out of mineral pigments.
                          used animal fat to make the paint bind! otherwise it would get off in a couple of years.
                          says blowing the paint of the wall is like breathing the painting into life!!!
                          Also they left a kind of signature - put their hand on the cave and blow the color on top of it - to leave a shaddow of a hand.

                          The animals are often paint into the cracks that appear in the stone - natural cracks.

                - interesting that they start to make art at around 40.000BC, so they speak of "behaviorally modern" vs "anatomically modern" humans.
                     - what makes this difference? Did it come with the ice age tech. revolution? Is it a cultural acquisition, is art invented?
                       No idea!

                     Problem: we see complex societies hunting together etc, at around 80.000 years, so they must have had some language, be able to plan your actions. 
                     Language is a big deal - capacity of abstraction, visualization, conceptualization, but where is art?

                - maybe this is the wrong argument: we might have had different forms of art, like bodily art - tattoos, body paint, hair ornaments, Jewels, performing arts - but these would not last. 
                - maybe they did arts, but not on durable media. (we have some clay figures from 15.000BC, and it survived, big wonder!
                    - sometimes there are religious prohibitions against permanent art

                - what about Neandthertal? We don't see any art from them - maybe it just didn't survive? hard to know...
                    - ladder like figures in La Pasiega cave - dated to much older than 64000 - could have been made by Neandthertal!


        - Why did they do the cave paintings?
            - no piles of trash, so they didn't seem to have lived there.
            - where did they take the light? says they had lanterns out of stone!
              these must have been sacred places!!!
            - paintings are often placed deep down the cave, not near the entrance!
                - probably due to some ritual meaning of the caves.
            - says they were active for thousands of years

            - painting the animals that they hunt?
                - some paintings are much larger than the animal some are smaller
                - they often paint animal over the top of another animal (cave of Trois Freres 17000BC) also in Lascaux cave (13000-15000bc) Chavueat cave - multiple horse paintings, one over the other, redrawn multiple times... a rhinoceros repainted seven times!
                    - says they had ritual meaning, once the ritual ends you can paint another animal over the top of it.
                    - is it some kind of renewal of the animal spirit?
                    - some pictures have strike marks, so maybe that was some kind of symbolic killing / renewing of the animal?
                      must have had some shaman, he paints it, then comes someone who 'kills' the painting - like a voodoo doll.
                      it may be a symbolic action that is supposed to give the hunter good fortune, or something like that!
                    - or maybe not: the indians(and in Mongolia) have rituals: after you kill an animal you need to give an offering to appease the spirit of the animal! or to kill the spirit of an already hunted animal (whatever)

                    - like the Altamira they painted them to fit into the cracks of the cave
                      as if they went into the cave to find the animal, the artist is liberating what he is already seeing, as if in some vision state.
        
                      Also paleolithic scultptures: you would carve an animal to fit the shape of the stone!  sort as if to honor the spirit of the object.
                      
                      Says its like paredoilia - seeing an image in a naturally existing object (sort of like the pebble of Makapansgat)

             - narrative? in cave of Trois Freres they have a guy in a bison skin (as if they pay someone who is hunting - telling a story)

               also a man as if lying in front of a bison (also some kind of story)

             - sculptures: Venus figurines - seem to symbolize fertility (often fit into a hand, probably personal, totem items)
                 - women with big buttocks, big breasts - small faces. emphasizing the parts needed to bear children!
                   Venus of Willendorf (but she has a big head, by comparison, but no face)
                   Venus of Brassempuoy has a face, but not very emphasized
                   They all seem exaggerated, abstract!
            

        - naturalism vs abstraction
            - naturalism - imitation of nature
            - abstraction - don't look like nature, has exaggeration (representing some concept?)
                    
            - Lascaux cave : the animal is drawn in great detail, while a person is just ab abstraction
              maybe there is some prohibition against drawing persons - you don't want to steel their soul. (maybe that was the purpose of the animal drawing...)

            - sometimes abstraction is the better communication tool (like with smileys) - to communicate some mental state, like happiness.
              sometimes the better tools is naturalism - it is a good tool to convey presence! (like with the bisons in the Lscaux cave)

            - the Venus figures are supposed to convey an idea - or function as a totem/talisman.
                - childbirth was a dangerous thing, so they needed an idealized figure to protect the owner - to represent the ideal of fertility.
                "art is a tool, a method of externalizing the internal (making the internal external), giving us a sense of control over the uncontrollable" (?)
                  (in other words, its soemething to deal with your fears, etc)

        
        - Conventions : arts tends to cheat
            - look at Mickey Mouse - you always see the ears, even when you see the mouse in profile!
            - same for cave paintings: they paint two horns even if you see the animal in profile. (but they cheat a little bit - the horns are slightly more bent than the face!) (Chauvet cave, Lascaux cave)  
             - these are conventions: tools to convey meaning, to show what the artist believes to be true - tool to add symbolism. (like stick figures in XKCD) 

             - Lion-man figure: 28000-30000 from Holhlenstein-Stadel - first time you see something that is not real, imaginary thing, combined thing!
                lots of theories what it means...  but he says it shows that people think more in concepts, if they can accept something imaginary...

             - Architecture: Mammoth Hut - 15000, Mezhirich Russia
               lots of Mammoth bones that were used to weigh down the Mammoth skins, but they bones were decorated, incised and painted!


Ancient near east: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_LcEo-_pLY 

    Fertile crescent - Israel, Syria, southern Turkey, Mesopotamia    
        has water sources (that's why it is called Fertile crescent)
            Levant - reasonable rainfall
            
        
    4000BC - bronze age (need 5-10% tin + bronze, can smelter the stuff at reasonably low temperatures)
        Sumer - 3500BC-2200BC  - writing, astronomical records, law (Greeks get lots of ideas from here!)
            Lots of independent city states 
        Akkadians 
        Neo-Sumerians
        Big break (no much written records)
        Old Babylonians (Amorites)
        Hittites

    each city is it's own state
        - founded on hierarchy (divine kingship)
        - religious centers (temples)
            - organized offices
            - organized rituals
            - community thing (main aspect as cultural binder)
            - builds on ideas of personal salvation
        - trade, writing

    what is civilization?
        - urban living, hierarchy, laws
        - division of labor & trade 
        - temples, centralized worship, organized system of worship

    (there is a system theory based definition of civilization)
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilization#Complex_systems
            Civilization as complex system - as 'group of objects that work in concert to produce some result'
            'Civilizations as networks of cities that emerge from pre-urban cultures and are defined by the economic, political, military, diplomatic, social and cultural interactions among them'

    Kingship := ordained by gods, king is the priest of the gods (no separation of church & state) (? Mesopotamia had separate temple institutions ?)
        - sometimes the kid is a 'god' (Akkadians liked that)
        - sometimes he is not a 'god', but gets his legitimacy from the gods (Sumerians liked that)
            - Gilgamesh: descendent from the gods
    
    11:05 Ishtar token (mass produced) (from Akkadian times) - associated with planet Venus (
        Says you can see it's a goddess
            - standing on the back of lions
            - flanked by owls 
            - has wings
            - has knots (symbol of authority)
            - bull horn crown)

    Writing: 

    Specialization of whole cities 
        (laws of competitive advantage: is someone is good at making cloths, then no use to employ him in any other area)

Timeline:
    
    Paleolithic - (old stone age) 2.5m years ago - 

        Upper paleolithic - 50.000 years ago (lots of new tech!)

    Mesolithic (middle stone age) 20.000 years ago
        - dogs where domesticated at this time!

    Neolithic (new stone age) 12.000  years ago ... 2000 years ago
        - big leap: animal domestication, agriculture, hunting with bow & arrow, fiber arts, etc
    
    Bronze age (5000 years ago - but not in all areas of the world)

    (this is all relative to social/technological development - Britain in 5000BC was in the Neolithic, but Egypt was in the Bronze age!)

Sahara dessert
    10000BC - ice age comes to an end

    10000BC years ago it was a savannah, lots of grass, animals - people
        You have paintings of giraffes carved into rocks, from that time!
        
        end of ice age: people start to cultivate animal herds - pastoralism (big change from hunting/gathering)
            - nomadic people, have to move their herds around.
            - they now have a food surplus (don't have to deal with hunting all day!), more time to develop a culture, don't need to run an hunt/gather all of the time!
                - people can now specialize in their tasks, develop new professions like basket weaving
                - and now trade starts between these specializations!
                - more art as well!
                    - beautiful panels (Tassili N'ajier - Nigeria) - not in caves, in overhangs.
                        - they get the proportions right, between animal and people!
                        - people spreading nets, herding animals, boat, variety of clothing - that's a new variety of stuff!
            
        Near east - lots of action here! The agricultural revolution - takes long time (12000BC-5000BC)
            - agriculture means more food security, more surplus, etc.
                - permanent settlements 
                - need animals bulls to pull your tools

            - Mesopotamia  (between the two rivers Tigris and Euphrates - water for irrigation)
                - dig canals for irrigation,
                - lots of permanent settlements here
            - Levant 
                - don't need canals, there is more rain here.

            - Periods
                - pre 6000BC - pre pottery
                - Pottery neolithic - after 6000BC
                    - needs lots of skill, like removing all the air bubbles out of the clay - otherwise the pots explode in the kiln...
                    - dating by find different styles of pottery on the same layer of excavation!
                
                - also cloth weaving and baskets weaving.

                - took quite a while to figure out the technology, this is complex stuff and needs specialization!

                - metal working, with copper (Chalcolithic)


        Used to think that you absolutely require agriculture for the food surplus for big monumental colture
        Wrong! Gobekli Tepe in Anatolia, Turkey happened without agriculture ("it's like finding a steam engine in the middle ages, shouldn't be there" - (well, Heron of alexandria's steam engine happened in Roman times!!!)

            - large T shape monupents (up to 15 tons) standing in circle! - happened before agriculture 10000-11500 years ago (carbon dated)!
                - carvings of animals - all wild, no domesticated animals! 
                  dug up the trash pits - (lots of info there, what did they eat?) - no sheeps and goats, they ate wild gazelles, before animal domestication!!!
                  shocking conclusion - as there is no surplus at that time.
                - you need skilled artists and lots of stuff for the building: lots of tools and Human specialists, diversification of labor, societies of hundreds and thousands!
                - you can't do it with a small tribe, and they had all of this without agriculture!
        
        Guess: quasi domestication: instead of domestication the animal you shape the environment: kill of all predators burn the prarie so that there will be more grass, then you get more gazelles!

                - maybe agriculture is not a prerequisite to social stratification?
                  maybe social stratification came first? then came agriculture - when people pushed their environment to the limit!!!
                  If its true then culture comes first technological progress comes later!!!

                - problem of trust: smaller societies have trust, you know everyone around and trust them.
                  you don't have this with larger society, you need some cultural glue to hold everyone together, you need religion.
                  Goblekki Teppe is a religious site!

                - first you need to organize your society, bring people together by building a temple, then you can do agriculture!!!


       Timeline: 
            - it's 8000 years between Goebekli Teppe and Sumer (3400BC) - the start of history, when they wrote stuff down
                There must be lots of stuff out there that we don't know about!!!  
            - its 5400 years from then until now.

       Catal Huyuk settlement (occupied for 400 years)
            - mud brick houses with common walls (says to make it it easier to defend)
            - open areas, family units, shrines?
            - ceramic sculptures
            - female figure (again with emphasized breasts and abdomen) with leopards around here - mother/fertility goddess?
            - landscape fresco: town with nearby volcanic eruption!  (says that actually happened at the time!)
        
        Jericho near the dead sea! 
            - neolithic village - dated to 9000BC - pre pottery!
            - defensive structures - speaks of organized society - watchtowers were discovered
            - plastered skull: human skulls - an attempt to preserve the body for the afterlife (lots of cultures here deal with that!)
                - disinterred bodies, took the skull and sealed it in bitumen (like asphalt) put shells into the eyes
