Egypt - digging/repair of canals was the duty of the Pharao - first duty for a provincial governor.
    - used to flood the land, while the Nile was high

Mesopotamia - Trigris & Euphrates covers more silt than the Nile! The rivers change their course more often and rise faster!
    "Over the centuries, the agriculture of Mesopotamia began to decay because of the salt in the alluvial soil. Then, in 1258, the Mongols conquered Mesopotamia and destroyed the irrigation systems."

    they invented pottery some 6500BC - that makes dating easier

Ceramics/Pottery - stuff for consumption, but also as grave goods.

    Nile clay - you fetch the clay from the river Nile. (or irrigation canals coming from the Nile)
        - high silicon content and high iron oxide content
            - turns red or brown when fired, unfired: from grey to black
        - used for household or ritual purposes

    Marl clay - you mine the clay from limestone deposits (a bit away from the Nile, in the desert)
        - lower silicon content and more calcium
            - cream or white when fired. Fire >1000C gives olive green color.
        - 'principally used for storage and prestige objects like figural vessels'

Each time had its own type of decorations, different motifs in the paintings.

They get the clay to the workship, it often dried into a lump. Need to add water if you want to shape it.
Then you have to prepare the clay
    - remove small stones and impurities: (dry & crush, clean it with a sieve) or elutrication (put it into the water, skim the fine clay off the top)
    - soften the clay (tread on it, so to make it softer)

    - now you can add supplements - temper, this makes it "more malleable and stable during production, and also more porous, which made it easier to dry, bake, and use the finished vessel."

    - now you have lots of air bubble in the clay; if you put that into the oven then the air bubbles heat up and your art project explodes.
      You need to knead it, so as to remove the air bubbles. "In this process, two halves of a lump of clay were beaten against one another with significant force"

Now you get started: need to shape the clay
    - hand shaping (used from pre-dynastic period to old kingdom)

        - Free modelling by kneading and pulling (oldest technique) (you see pressure marks where pieces of clay have been joined)
        - coiling: you make thin sheets of clay, and stack these sheets up https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coiling_(pottery)
        - weaving the stripes of clay. (if it breaks up then you get rectangular pieces)

    - rotating pilaster/pedestal - the result looks more symmetric, you get something with a more narrow opening.
    
    - slow potter wheels, turns around a central axis. You turn the wheel with one hand, and shape the vessel with the other.
        - invented in the fourth dynasty (2613BC - 2494BC - the "golden age" of egypt, when they build the pyramids)
          You also get mass production - "It enabled standardisation and the rapid production of finished vessels."

    - fast potter wheel : you turn it with the foot (get that in the new kingdom - 1550BC - eighteenth dynasty)

    - Mold
        used for things like open baking pans: you can put the clay in a mold out of wood.

Post processing
     - can polish it now, that it is still damp (rubbing without applying slight pressure)
        - jugs between old kingdom to middle kingdom

Drying 
    water from clay must evaporates, but take that the vessel doesn't shrink!
    - leave it under the sun, put it in the shade in the summer
    - can take several days, even after that some 3-5% water remain! these have to get out during subsequent firing. (if you don't do that then it the vapor turns to steam and your art project explodes during firing) 
    - at this stage you can decorate it, make incisions or impressions. "when the clay was still damp enough that it would not break in the process, but was dry enough that no raised areas would be left in the incisions."
      
    - now is the time to finish the base. 
        - by hand - until the seventeenth dynasty (until Hyksos intermediate period)
        - later they used a potters wheel - and you see rotation marks on the base.


Firing : once it is dry you can put it into a fire: heat it up slowly, so that remaining moisture gets out.

    lots of tricks here:
        - earliest: open fire/pit fire; put the wood into the pot and burn it in an open fire. (little control over oxydation)
            "Pots fired in a firing pit often have a black upper rim" the black is carbon that comes from the smoke (but there are lots of tricks here, to get that consistently)

    you can do more complicated stuff with a kiln (special oven)
        - if you put in little oxygen then the resulting pots looks gray or dark brown color (because of lots of carbon monoxide and you get brown black iron oxide)
        - if you put lots of oxygen you get red or red brown pots

    The kilns get more complicated if you separate the fire from the ceramics/pots. (this is called grating)     


Classification systems for Egyptian pottery:
    Vienna system (1980)
    Seriation system (1899)
