J. Makkay. The Origins of the “Temple-Economy” as seen in the Light of Prehistoric Evidence"
DOI: 10.2307/4200170

Gelb and Diakonoff : temple economy was about a third of the whole economy (5000 years ago)
- but it had a big role: the money was 'accumulated, re-invested or utilized through long-distance trade' (unlike private/communal sector)

How and when did the temple get hold of land ownership?

When?
    - Diakonoff: happened during Uruk IV-III; reason: coercion, ideology, sheer force
                 temple estates 'gradually absorbed public or community holdings during the Uruk IV - III'

    - Gibson: reason was "triggered off by the disintegration of the tribal system, combined with
a natural crisis, a shift of population, the violation of the fallow system and the
development of long-distance trade."

    - Jacobsen: surpluses were first produced to provide offerings for community temples, and they knew how to store them.

    - Gelb: land was owned by the community, then with centralized state the crown/temple/nobility grabbed it.

How?
    - Deimel: you can coerce necessary corvee labor when the land is claimed by the temple

    - Others: temple cannot have initiated reinvestment process, you need other pre-existing conditions/institutions(?)

     Gibson says a combination of reasons was the cause:
        - disintegration of tribal system in combination with natural crisis
        - shift of population
        - violation of fallow system (when land is left for one or more vegetative cycles, so that it can regenerate https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallow ) 
        - long distance trade
       also some places were "so strategic that to avoid conflict they were considered sacred"

    - Jacobsen: surpluses first produced to make religious offerings, then the temple stored these surpluses (then accumulation started?)

    Author: ideology was secondary, subordinate to economic factors.

Why didn't the state gain total control over the economy?

    Continued existence of temples/sanctuaries gave them a priority (over the state) in economic matters
        Temple seems to have been earlier than the state, as a continuation of earlier organisations/systems (when the tribal/communal systems ruled)
        Then came the big break with the tribal system (here kinship plays a big role, unlike with the state). Says a series of crisis triggered the transition towards the state.


What kind of temple economy existed five thousand years ago?

    a. estates owned by the temple, the so-called priestly land (n i g - e n. n a), cultivated by temple personnel;
    b. so-called maintenance fields (kur 6 , kurum) ;
    c. allotment fields (uru 4 -lal) which were leased from time to time;
    d. Temple administrative centres which controlled storage facilities, granaries and workshops and supervised the administration, redistribution and processing of surplus
    e. Offerings brought before the temple/deities as a part of various rites and rituals.

When did they start to produce of surpluses? How did they deal with it?
    Umm Dabaghiyah.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hassuna_culture#Archaic_Hassuna https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umm_Dabaghiyah-Sotto-Kultur
    this was a culture from 6th millenium BC (with pottery and "dry farming" (without irrigation, from rainfall))
    - they found closed complex of storage facilities (so there must have been a surplus)

    They say it is unlikely that land was owned by the temple (or sanctuary) at that time. How did the temple get hold of the surplus?

        - says to keep the temple running and for subsistence of the staff. They may have had religious rites to determine the amount to give.
          (you have an example at the Yarim Tepe site)

        - Very early practice of food offerings (Neolithic in Mesopotamia) so that temple got hold of some of the surplus as part of offerings. 
          But says that's not the main thing.

        - often granaries were under protection of the temple!  
          Catal Hiiyuk - figurines found in granaries (implies a sacral organization was involved/protected the communal granaries!!!)
          Khirbet el-Kera, kTepe Gawra - communal granaries were built in temple compound, says some of the stuff was used for non religious purposes (Ubaid period)
          Bevel rimmed bowls in Mesopotamia

        "These supplies were partly used for the benefit of the community (e.g. in periods of famine), but a large portion was undoubtedly mobilized, mainly through trade, since as we have already pointed out this was the largest amount of commodities which could be freely mobilized. "

         "The temple thus acquired land by the investment of this substantial capital, rather than by legal procedures, sheer force or ideological means."
          ---------------------------------

Egypt - digging/repair of canals was the duty of the Pharao - first duty for a provincial governor.
    - used to flood the land, while the Nile was high

Mesopotamia - Trigris & Euphrates covers more silt than the Nile! The rivers change their course more often and rise faster!
    "Over the centuries, the agriculture of Mesopotamia began to decay because of the salt in the alluvial soil. Then, in 1258, the Mongols conquered Mesopotamia and destroyed the irrigation systems."

----------

    they invented pottery some 6500BC - that makes dating easier
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Egyptian_pottery
https://handwiki.org/wiki/Engineering:Ancient%20Egyptian%20pottery

Ceramics/Pottery - stuff for consumption, but also as grave goods.

    Nile clay - you fetch the clay from the river Nile. (or irrigation canals coming from the Nile)
        - high silicon content and high iron oxide content
            - turns red or brown when fired, unfired: from grey to black
        - used for household or ritual purposes

    Marl clay - you mine the clay from limestone deposits (a bit away from the Nile, in the desert)
        - lower silicon content and more calcium
            - cream or white when fired. Fire >1000C gives olive green color.
        - 'principally used for storage and prestige objects like figural vessels'

Each time had its own type of decorations, different motifs in the paintings.

They get the clay to the workship, it often dried into a lump. Need to add water if you want to shape it.
Then you have to prepare the clay
    - remove small stones and impurities: (dry & crush, clean it with a sieve) or elutrication (put it into the water, skim the fine clay off the top)
    - soften the clay (tread on it, so to make it softer)

    - now you can add supplements - temper, this makes it "more malleable and stable during production, and also more porous, which made it easier to dry, bake, and use the finished vessel."

    - now you have lots of air bubble in the clay; if you put that into the oven then the air bubbles heat up and your art project explodes.
      You need to knead it, so as to remove the air bubbles. "In this process, two halves of a lump of clay were beaten against one another with significant force"

Now you get started: need to shape the clay
    - hand shaping (used from pre-dynastic period to old kingdom)

        - Free modelling by kneading and pulling (oldest technique) (you see pressure marks where pieces of clay have been joined)
        - coiling: you make thin sheets of clay, and stack these sheets up https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coiling_(pottery)
        - weaving the stripes of clay. (if it breaks up then you get rectangular pieces)

    - rotating pilaster/pedestal - the result looks more symmetric, you get something with a more narrow opening.
    
    - slow potter wheels, turns around a central axis. You turn the wheel with one hand, and shape the vessel with the other.
        - invented in the fourth dynasty (2613BC - 2494BC - the "golden age" of egypt, when they build the pyramids)
          You also get mass production - "It enabled standardisation and the rapid production of finished vessels."

    - fast potter wheel : you turn it with the foot (get that in the new kingdom - 1550BC - eighteenth dynasty)

    - Mold
        used for things like open baking pans: you can put the clay in a mold out of wood.

Post processing
     - can polish it now, that it is still damp (rubbing without applying slight pressure)
        - jugs between old kingdom to middle kingdom

Drying 
    water from clay must evaporates, but take that the vessel doesn't shrink!
    - leave it under the sun, put it in the shade in the summer
    - can take several days, even after that some 3-5% water remain! these have to get out during subsequent firing. (if you don't do that then it the vapor turns to steam and your art project explodes during firing) 
    - at this stage you can decorate it, make incisions or impressions. "when the clay was still damp enough that it would not break in the process, but was dry enough that no raised areas would be left in the incisions."
      
    - now is the time to finish the base. 
        - by hand - until the seventeenth dynasty (until Hyksos intermediate period)
        - later they used a potters wheel - and you see rotation marks on the base.


Firing : once it is dry you can put it into a fire: heat it up slowly, so that remaining moisture gets out.

    lots of tricks here:
        - earliest: open fire/pit fire; put the wood into the pot and burn it in an open fire. (little control over oxydation)
            "Pots fired in a firing pit often have a black upper rim" the black is carbon that comes from the smoke (but there are lots of tricks here, to get that consistently)

    you can do more complicated stuff with a kiln (special oven)
        - if you put in little oxygen then the resulting pots looks gray or dark brown color (because of lots of carbon monoxide and you get brown black iron oxide)
        - if you put lots of oxygen you get red or red brown pots

    The kilns get more complicated if you separate the fire from the ceramics/pots. (this is called grating)     


Classification systems for Egyptian pottery:
    Vienna system (1980)
    Seriation system (1899)

Domestication of dogs

self domestication - less aggressive wolfs with more docile genes can stay longer around people. Maybe wolfs self selected for this trait - outcast wolfs hang around human camps, then they become proto-wolfs

symbiotic mutualism - wolfs and humans are similar  
    - hunt the same animals
    - life in the same environment 
    - both have complex social groups.
        - both have hierarchies
        - communicate between each other
        - hunt cooperatively
So wolfs and humans come into a lot of contact while hunting (either humans come first or wolfs come first).
Maybe wolfs and humans started to cooperate while hunting! 
    -wolfs eating the bones after us, so they start to get close to humans
    -humans study how wolfs hunt: like wearing wolf pelts to get closer to bison groups (indians do that)


Artificial selection: Humans breed and select for traits in animals 
    - ? humans were trapping & keeping them captive - to get their furs for clothes. 

Pet wolf (Pinocchio)
    - people adopted wild wolf (?) 
      problem: have to constantly train them, takes a lot of time


How long does domestication take?
    - Dmitry Belyaye managed to domesticate foxes in thirty generations!


Dogs come from 20.000 years ago (genetic dating)
    - that was a  Pleistocene Period wolf (now extinct) - the ancestor of dog and gray wolf.
