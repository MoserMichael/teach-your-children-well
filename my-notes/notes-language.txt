The Neuroscience of Language and Thought, Dr. George Lakoff Professor of Linguistics

    pictures of the brain show the ratio of oxygenated/de-oxygenated blood. 
    Neuron fires - they use some of the oxygen in the blood
    Each pixel stands for 3mm x 3mm cube, that's lots of neurons - about 120.000.000 - each with lots of connections!
    we don't know what happens with the connections, that's where neural computation comes in (?)

    How do we get ideas? Says we are figuring!

    Englightenment reason - derived from Descartes; says Neuroscience does not agree with assumptions (shocking)
        Myth: "reason is conscious" and "reason is linear" (one step after another) - not true for most thought!  
            Experiments show that reason is a parallel process!
                - take a sentence, guess what the next sentence should be in a paragraph. You answer much faster than it would, if you were doing the stuff linearly.
                - if everything was linear, then you would not be able to do that!

         Myth: emotion gets in the way of reason (in enlightenment reason)
             - says not true. If you have a stroke that damages emotion then you can't reason.
               Emotion is requirement for reason! Without emotion you don't know what to want (as you don't know what to prefer - that's based on emotion) - you don't know your objectives, that makes it hard to reason!
               People with this type of brain damage act randomly, don't know how to plan, don't know how to set goals!

         Myth: reasoning is abstract?
            Says it is embodied - that makes it meaningful.

         You can reason about anything in the world. Not true: embodied reasoning means it is connected to the world, and you can only reason what is connected to you!
                - politics: may not understand everything, just what fits your picture of the world!
            - ideas made meaningful through our experiences and our connection to the world ... via our brains connection to our body!

         Myth: reason is based on mathematical logic
            - math. logic did not work to explain reasoning in natural language

         Myth: reason serves your self interest
            - says reason mainly serves empathy and social connection, self interest is secondary here...
            - empathy is physical: Vittorio Gallese trains monkeys to push buttons, etc. Probes in their brains in pre-motor cortex, see which neurons fire.
                - same neurons fire if monkey peals banana, and if it watches you eat one.
                - there is a connection between vision and action: mostly same neurons are active when you or someone else peels a banana!
                    Mirror neurons: link vision and action. There are pathways between that link brain regions responsible for vision and action
                    mirror neurons also link vision to emotion: bodily state changes with emotion (body temperature rises with anger, etc)
                       empathy is based on this - your state changes with the perception of others! 
                    some of the mirror neurons fire both when acting out X and during perceiving X
              
                Basic level categories:
                     Elena Rush: categories higher level categories (furniture) have different properties vs more immediate categories (chair)
                     - you can have a mental picture of middle level category (a chair), but less so with higher level ones like furniture
                       here you have "gestalt perception", kids learn categories at that level!
                     - that's because mirror neurons: they still work on intermediate categories! 
                Verb roots: run (i am) and runs (he is), why are the same form for action and perception? same set of mirror neurons involved for action and perception!

                Asked people to memorize a picture and imaging them: same part active when seeing and imagining a thing! also for the use of language!
                    if you can't imagine a scene, then you don't understand a sentence. Understanding involves mental simulation - involving the same part of the brain that is involved in doing that action!

                Neuronal Groups, Functional subgroups, Nodes, functional circutry
                    - Jerry Feldman: cluster of neurons (dozens or hundreds) are involved in any action/perception
                      says you can see how many of them are involved for any such action (like peeling a banana?)
                    - there are intersections between the clusters: example: eating a peanut and put peanut in a cup!
                        - suggests theory: 
                            node := cluster of neurons required to do a particular action
                            functional circuits := generalization in the circuitry of the nodes
                         - topographic maps := structures that preserve closeness (in attributes like location, connection, timing, frequency, intensity, speed, directionality)
                              - (didn't understand the explanation of how that works...)
                              - says similar mechanism for auditory stimuli (not just visual ones)
                              - says these mappings explain phantom limb syndrom (after amputation), the map that connects to the sensor input is still there!
                              - connections across maps: (says that's all you need for conceptual thought, that's a hypothesis)
                                     - Gestalt circuits
                                        - responsible for frames. (like the Hospital image - that activates the whole set of experience)
                                     - Binding circuits
                                        example: word 'into' stands for container relationship, this activates map for interior, boundary, exterior, these are tied togather!
                                        Also used to form compound frames that stand for complex objects; example: restaurant, has its own frame - but it has other related frames: this is a business (business frame), food service frame, host-guest frame
 
                                     - gated activations
                                        ??                
                                     - gated inhibitions
                                        ??
                            
                   - Learning: number of neural connection decreases a lot during first five years of life (those that are least used die off - if you don't learn something early then you won't get it...)
                     says learning a concepts means to create some neural circuitry - by strengthening the synapses that connect some neurons (they must fire in order to get strengtened).
                         Hebbian learning
                             Learning means strengthening circuits between already existing circuits, (that means it is building upon prior knowledge)
                         long term potentiation/long term depression
                             Happens during trauma/or if you are very happy - neuro transmitters increase connection strength - or inhibit it from forming
                             Some hormones that are released in times of stress (or happiness) help here!
                         Time dependent placticity (weird stuff)
                             When two neurons are connected to each other and both fire at the same time, then the first/stronger then the first/stronger one wins over the other (it sets the direction of the connection)
                             Says this determines the structure of a metaphor.
                                How so? Metaphor is a mapping across different regions in the brain, (like 'love is a journey'r simple 
                                metaphors are learned early, before language. Now you see directionality - affection is warmth, not the other way round.
                                Says a metaphor is created by experience - and the more dominant stimulus determines the direction of association! (or something like that)
                                (i am not sure if these metaphora are universal, or dependent on culture and language... no-one asked... Also who decides what is primary and secondary? no idea...)

                    - embodied cognition gives experimental evidence:
                       says metaphorical structure determines behavior. 
                       examples:
                            - if you think about the future you lean forwards (the future is ahead), the past - you lean backwards (sounds very dependent on culture)
                            - you get warm/cold coffee, and met someone. With warm coffee your experience is mostly positive/nice, with cold one it is negative (??? can you reproduce that??) affection is warmth.
                            - remember a time when snubbed vs accepted. when asked to remember being accepted you judge the temperature in the room to be warmer.
                            - etc. etc.
                       says that is evidence that these metaphors are physically there, and they structure your thoughts and actions.

                    - how do these primary metaphors work?
                        tries to model the network, says its accurate (didn't understand the concept)

                     - gated activation:                        
                         (didn't understand it either...)   

                     - Modularity vs Cascade: 
                        - modularity: old view: you have centers in the brain that do something special
                        - cascade: new view: lots of areas are activated to give meaning to a particular thing, through a process called cascades.
                              Binding circuits link entities from two different maps into a third map (?)
                              cascades := neuronal groups linked via bi-directional circuits. (says concepts/language use these)
                                 says additional layers add detail in each layer; one for background), lines, orientation, etc.
                                 so you have a cascade for example to recognize the letter E; (some layer recognizing spatioal combination of lines, each layer is simple, the complicated stuff comes out when they do a pipeline)
        
                                
                                 example: any act of commerce is an exchange - mutual transfer between actors. There is a binding into a exchange layers from two transfer layers (each layer fits to a possession layer (someone is the owner of a, someone the owner of b, and a <-> b are exchanged, transferred)
                                 all this is involved in any commercial transactions. 

                                 in addition you can apply metaphors ("i don't buy that")
                                 meaning to be embodied: all these cascades / concepts are rooted in the body

                                 words are defined via a gestalt circuit linking it to a node in a frame.   
                                    How does grammar work?
                                        - a noun: 'a name of a person placer thing' - something in the phonology linked to a frame via a gestalt node that is linking between the phonology and its meaning. (???)
                                        - these gestalt nodes place a hierarchical structure (of grammar) onto a linear structure (speech) - that's what grammar. (but that's ongoing research)

                        - why bother? you see that you can meaning out of neurons!
                            - says it's also matter in politics. 
                            - conservatives and progressive have different metaphorical systems - each one uses it to understand the world.
                                - governing institutions: family, religion, team, nation, etc. Now different types of morality govern different kinds of family.
                                  now that has to do with different kinds of well being as a child -> these result to different models of morality. Says morality is determined by a dozen set of metaphors. (says he wrote a book about it 'philosophy in the flesh')



         Myth: rational thought is value free (about what is true in the world)
            - your in-built concern with empathy/emotions doesn't let that happen

         Myth: rationality is universal, everyone reasons the same
            - so that the same argument applies to everyone (doesn't happen)
            - says many concepts are universal, some are not (those that very with language)
         
         Myth: there is an objective structure to the world and you can think about it in terms of logic, without frames of metaphor
            - says everything comes of of these basic mechanisms in the brain, which are frames and metaphors, etc.

         Myth: Chomsky says : language is purely formal and abstract (but he said that about grammar). Grammar is independent of meaning
           - says language is the product of an embodied human brain
             you can't negate deictic locative construction -> therefore the meaning of the sentence is dictating the grammar of he same sentence.

    The following explains these assertion:::

    Embodied reasoning (these aspects show in any language)  -- enlightenment reason, logic don't deal with such concepts!

        -logic of image schemas
            brain structures that structures imagery.
            Example: containers - example: auditorium is a container (for people), glass of water is a container (for water)
                - Image schema: a brain structure that can compute any kind of container  (Terry Regier) (can tell you what the bounds are, what is inside, what is outside)
                - image schema structures both space and your mental imagery; (you say 'i am going into it' that means there is a path from the outside to the inside) 
                - says there are special neurons that represent parts of your body, that allows to thing about 'in front of me, behind me'

                - allows for transitivity: a inside container b, b inside container c -> a inside c
        
        -process schemas (aspectual schemas)    
            - what is the pre/post conditions, what is the middle, is it iterated? is it a sub-process?

                    
        -frames - these are bigger schemas 
            - imagine a hospital, there are roles (doctor, patient), rooms, etc.
            - know things about hospitals: doctors deal with patients
            - says if you say 'surgery' then the whole hospital frame comes up.
            - charles fillmore: every word defined by a frame (exercise: think of an elephant without a mental picture of the elephant, doesn't work! there is no elephant without the elephant framea
            - frames structure your world, these are circuits in your brain!

        -conceptual metaphors
            - mode of thought, 
            - example: love as a journey 'love as a crossroad' ; relationship -> vehicle, lovers have common live goals, difficulties -> impediments to goals.
            - says there are complex composed metaphors that consist of more basic metaphors
            

        -prototypes and narratives

   How do we make sense of stuff and what is the state of the research?
        - physics: color is wavelength, but you perceive them separately because of color cones in the eyes -> neurocircutes to perceive these colors.
          so no color that is independent of your perception
        - idea that meaning is a matter of truth in the world: 


  Q&A: 
    - says some stuff is dependent on culture; some psychological experiments sound dependent on cultural setting.
    - a: agrees.

    - what about hand writing? (relating to the cascades for recognizing letters)
      a: says the same mechanism is in use, maybe some other instance of it?

    - politics. bla bla.
