Charles Seife - Zero

- fear of zero,

- linked to fear of chaos:
    Greeks: darkness is the mother of all things, from darkness sprang chaos
    Jews: in the beginning there was chaos: Tohu va-bohu

- a zero alone misbehaves:
    number-a + another-number = number-b ; number-b != number-a
    number-a + zero = number-a (unchanged!)

    this violates axiom of archimedes: any-number * n , if n gets bigger then the product will exceed any other number!    
- why does multiplication with zero result in zero?

    because associativity:

    a * (b + c) = a * b + b * c
    
    a * b = a * (b + 0)  because b = b + 0

    now 
    a * b = a * b + a * 0 

    now therefore 

    a * 0 = 0

- Multiplication is like stretching the rubber band of numbers! multiply by two, and you stretch it two times!

  Now multiply by zero, and all of the numbers collapse into a single point - zero!

- the madness starts with division:

    
    if we allow for division by 0:

        2 * 0 = 0 so 2 = 0 / 0 - because division is the inverse of multiplication

        4 * 0 = 0  so 4 = 0 / 0 

    And so it goes that any number equals any other number, which is not true!


    The only way out is to forbid division by zero! You can't do it, it is not allowed!!!

    The book gives an example of a big warship, that's a ship as big as a city - and it stopped moving at all.
    Because some important computer program stopped working - the program divided by zero, and that kills any computer program! Dividing by zero is not allowed!!!
    Some say that the ship had to be pulled by another ship, because it could not move on its own, and they didn't know how to fix the problem https://medium.com/dataseries/when-smart-ships-divide-by-zer0-uss-yorktown-4e53837f75b2 

    You often can get very big errors in calculation, if you skip over division by zero, you can prove anything if you allow division by zero.


Pythagoras didn't like zero
    - he thought that everything in nature is ruled by numbers.
