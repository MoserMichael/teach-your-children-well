One reason: our local schools are kind of, depressing. Also we have the summer vacations, so there is no choice: i must make an effort to keep my home front busy...

One thing that is especially depressing: teachers seem to get upset by questions. That means: many of them are not quite pushing kids to inquire about things.

A song by Crosby, Stills & Nash - Teach Your Children

Update: Well, i am no longer sure about the song: 'Teach your children well/Their father's hell will slowly go by' - history is part of us, it is hard to understand anything without looking at where things came from...
