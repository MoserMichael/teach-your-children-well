New project: I should focus more on my kids, instead of posting stupid stuff into social networks (or instead of coding up other useless stuff) "teach your children well" Let's try... 

I guess that social networks are turning into some kind of tool for social control, it's a new trick of those who are in charge:

Once upon a time they used to find a single narrative, one that would fit everyone.
They would then use that narrative and  push it through the tube, down the throat of everyone else.

Nowadays things changed: they are now assuming, that society is inherently divided into multiple tribes. Now the social networking thing is trying to build allegiances among the member of each particular tribe, instead of trying to find a common narrative.

Of course guess who is the gatekeeper that is to decides on what counts as "fake news" and "fake information", gotcha!

It's a change of focus in the tools used for brainwashing. I think that I should drop out of all this madness...

So here I am writing down my messages to my kids (these are being sent as short stories via WhatsApp).
Let's see if this medium works...

I am trying to tell interesting stories in simple English, on various topics of interest (see the other markdown files in this repository)
