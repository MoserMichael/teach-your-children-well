New project: I should focus more on my kids, so let's try... 

--

That's what we got right now:

- [something about art history - and lots of other things](https://github.com/MoserMichael/teach-your-children-well/blob/master/history-of-art-and-us.md)
- [something about the Bauhaus school of design](https://github.com/MoserMichael/teach-your-children-well/blob/master/bauhaus-design.md)
- [Some stuff of interest](https://github.com/MoserMichael/teach-your-children-well/blob/master/pop-science-and-other-stuff.md)

- [Internet course for beginners (pdf)](https://mosermichael.github.io/teach-your-children-well/internet-course-en-he.pdf)  (the same in [powerpoint](https://mosermichael.github.io/teach-your-children-well/internet-course-en-he.pptx)

One reason: our local schools are kind of, depressing. Also we have the summer vacations, so there is no choice: i must make an effort to keep my home front busy...

One thing that is especially depressing: teachers seem to be upset by questions. That means: many of them are not quite pushing kids to inquire about things.

Methodology:

So here I am writing down my messages to my kids (these are being sent as short stories via WhatsApp).
Let's see if this medium works...

I am trying to tell interesting stories in simple English, on various topics of interest (see the other markdown files in this repository)

A song by Crosby, Stills & Nash - Teach Your Children

Update: Well, i am no longer sure about the song: 'Teach your children well/Their father's hell will slowly go by' - history is part of us, it is hard to understand anything without looking at where things came from...
